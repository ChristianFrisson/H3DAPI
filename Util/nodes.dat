/// 2. If the colorIndex field is empty, the colours in the Color node are

/// e. If colorPerVertex is TRUE, colours are applied to each vertex, as

/// 1. If the colorIndex field is not empty, colours are applied to each
///    vertex of the IndexedFaceSet in exactly the same manner that the

/// If the color field is NULL, the geometry shall be rendered normally

/// If the normal field is not NULL, it shall contain a Normal node whose
/// normals are applied to the vertices or faces of the IndexedFaceSet in

/// colours to vertices/faces (where normalPerVertex corresponds to
/// colorPerVertex and normalIndex corresponds to colorIndex). If the
/// normal field is NULL, the browser shall automatically generate
/// normals, using creaseAngle to determine if and how normals are
/// smoothed across shared vertices (see 11.2.3 Common geometry fields).
/// 
/// If the texCoord field is not NULL, it shall contain a
/// TextureCoordinate node. The texture coordinates in that node are
/// applied to the vertices of the IndexedFaceSet as follows:
///
/// f. If the texCoordIndex field is not empty, then it is used to choose
///    texture coordinates for each vertex of the IndexedFaceSet in exactly

///    in the TextureCoordinate node.
/// 
/// g. If the texCoordIndex field is empty, then the coordIndex array is used
///    to choose texture coordinates from the TextureCoordinate node. If the
///    greatest index in the coordIndex field is N, then there shall be N+1
///    texture coordinates in the TextureCoordinate node.
/// 
/// If the texCoord field is NULL, a default texture coordinate mapping is
/// calculated using the local coordinate system bounding box of the

/// coordinates, and the next longest defines the T coordinates. If two or
/// all three dimensions of the bounding box are equal, ties shall be
/// broken by choosing the X, Y, or Z dimension in that order of
/// preference. The value of the S coordinate ranges from 0 to 1, from one
/// end of the bounding box to the other. The T coordinate ranges between
/// 0 and the ratio of the second greatest dimension of the bounding box
/// to the greatest dimension. Figure 13.6 illustrates the default texture
/// coordinates for a simple box shaped IndexedFaceSet with an X dimension
/// twice as large as the Z dimension and four times as large as the Y
