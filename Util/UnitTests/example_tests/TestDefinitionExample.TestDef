#  Contains the definitions for one or more test cases.
#  Every test case is specified with a section in this file and the name of that section will be the name of the test case
#  Required parameters:
#    x3d - Specifies the x3d file to run the test with.
#    baseline folder - Specifies where the baselines for this test are.
#    script - A .py file containing the test script itself.
#  Optional parameters:
#    starttime - Defaults to 1. How long h3d should wait after launching before it starts doing the test, specified in seconds.
#    timeout - Defaults to 1. A timeout that starts counting down immediately after h3d is launched. This should be longer than the expected time of your test, as a test will be considered failed if it times out. This timeout is primarily for when H3D has frozen, since the timeout will be the only way to shut down a frozen H3D automatically and continue with the testing.
