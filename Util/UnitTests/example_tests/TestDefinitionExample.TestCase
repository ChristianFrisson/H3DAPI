#  
#  Contains the definitions for one or more unit tests.
#  Every test is specified with a section in this file and the name of that section will be the name of the TestCase
#  Required parameters:
#    type - Specifies the type of test to run. For example "rendering", "performance", "log", and so on.
#    x3d - Specifies the x3d file to run the test on
#    baseline - Specifies where the baseline for this test is.
#               For a rendering test this would be the baseline output folder
#  Optional parameters:
#    script - A .py file containing testing scripts. Check TestScriptExample.py.
#    starttime - How long h3d should wait after launching before it starts doing the test, specified in seconds
#    runtime - How long h3d should run for before terminating the test, specified in seconds (Note: not used for rendering tests, it will stop after it is done running through all the test steps or until it has taken its startup rendering)
