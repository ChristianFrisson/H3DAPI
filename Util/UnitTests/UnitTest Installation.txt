Both 32bit and 64bit versions of all of this software should work, but you must ensure you use the same architecture for everything except imagemagick (but it's probably safer to use the same architecture for that as well.)

Software to install:

ImageMagick 6.9.3 Q16 (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php)
Python 2.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2711/)
MySQL Connector C 6.0.2 (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/, make sure you install version 6.0.2 and that it installs into "Program Files (x86)" rather than "Program Files", as the installer for the MySQL-python package might fail otherwise.)
Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7 (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266)
Python for Windows Extensions (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)

Required path entries:

system path:
Python27 folder (not bin, installer asks if you want to it add this automatically)
ImageMagick folder (not bin, installer asks if you want it to add this automatically)


Installing the MySQL-python package (provides the MySQLdb module):

MySQLdb (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/)
Can be installed by opening python and running "python -m pip install MySQL-python" from anywhere
You must ensure you installed the right version of MySQL Connector C and that you installed it into Program Files (x86)
