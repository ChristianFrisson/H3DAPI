#  
#  Contains the definitions for a unit test.
#  Required parameters:
#    type - Specifies the type of test to run. For example "screenshot", "benchmark", "log", and so on.
#    x3d - Specifies the x3d file to run the test on
#    baseline - Specifies where the baseline for this test is.
                For a screenshot test this would be the baseline folder or possibly a filename with the assumption that if the test contains multiple
                steps with their own screenshots then the screenshot-grabbing function will suffix them with _1, _2, and so on. 
                For a log test this would be the log output file, for a benchmark test it would be the performance data file, and so on.
#  Optional parameters:
#    script - A .py file containing testing scripts. Check TestScriptExample.py.
#
