  /// \class Viewpoint
  /// \brief The Viewpoint node defines a viewpoint that provides a perspective view
  /// of the scene. A perspective view is one in which all projectors are coalesce at
  /// position.
  ///
  /// The fieldOfView field specifies a preferred minimum viewing angle from this
  /// viewpoint in radians. A small field of view roughly corresponds to a telephoto
  /// lens; a large field of view roughly corresponds to a wide-angle lens. The field
  /// of view shall be greater than zero and smaller than pi. The value of fieldOfView
  /// represents the minimum viewing angle in any direction axis perpendicular to the
  /// view.
  /// A browser with a rectangular viewing projection has the following relationship:
  ///   display width    tan(FOVhorizontal/2) \n
  ///   -------------- = -------------------  \n
  ///   display height   tan(FOVvertical/2)   \n
  ///
  /// where the smaller of display width or display height determines which angle
  /// equals the fieldOfView (the larger angle is computed using the relationship
  /// described above). The larger angle shall not exceed pi and may force the smaller
  /// angle to be less than fieldOfView in order to sustain the aspect ratio.
