  /// \class Material
  /// \brief The Material node specifies surface material properties for 
  /// associated geometry nodes and is used by the X3D lighting equations
  /// during rendering. See the Lighting component of the X3D specification
  /// for a detailed description of the X3D lighting model equations.
  /// All of the fields in the Material node range from 0.0 to 1.0.
  /// 
  /// The fields in the Material node determine how light reflects off an
  /// object to create colour: 
  ///
  /// - The ambientIntensity field specifies how much ambient light from light
  /// sources this surface shall reflect. Ambient light is omnidirectional
  /// and depends only on the number of light sources, not their positions
  /// with respect to the surface. Ambient colour is calculated as
  /// ambientIntensity × diffuseColor.
  ///
  /// - The diffuseColor field reflects all X3D light sources depending on the
  /// angle of the surface with respect to the light source. The more
  /// directly the surface faces the light, the more diffuse light reflects.  
  ///
  /// - The emissiveColor field models "glowing" objects. This can be useful
  /// for displaying pre-lit models (where the light energy of the room is
  /// computed explicitly), or for displaying scientific data.  
  ///
  /// - The specularColor and shininess fields determine the specular
  /// highlights (e.g., the shiny spots on an apple). When the angle from
  /// the light to the surface is close to the angle from the surface to the
  /// viewer, the specularColor is added to the diffuse and ambient colour
  /// calculations. Lower shininess values produce soft glows, while higher
  /// values result in sharper, smaller highlights.  
  ///
  /// - The transparency field specifies how "clear" an object is, with 1.0
  /// being completely transparent, and 0.0 completely opaque. 
  ///

  /// \dotfile Material.dot
