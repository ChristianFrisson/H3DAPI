  /// \ingroup AbstractNodes
  /// \class X3DInterpolatorNode
  /// \brief The abstract node X3DInterpolatorNode forms the basis for
  /// all types of interpolators specified in this clause.
  ///
  /// The key field contains the list of key times, which could appear as:
  ///
  ///    key [0 0.25 0.65 0.75 1]
  ///
  /// to indicate there are five key frames in this node. The keyValue field
  /// contains values for the target field, one complete set of values for
  /// each key. Interpolator nodes containing no keys in the key field shall
  /// not produce any events. However, an input event that replaces an empty
  /// key field with one that contains keys will cause the interpolator node
  /// to produce events the next time that a set_fraction event is
  /// received..
  ///
  /// The set_fraction inputOnly field receives an SFFloat event and causes
  /// the interpolator node function to evaluate, resulting in a
  /// value_changed output event of the specified type with the same
  /// timestamp as the set_fraction event.
  ///
  /// The contents of the keyValue and value_changed fields are dependent on
  /// the type of the node (e.g., the PositionInterpolator fields use
  /// MFVec3f values). Each value or set of values in the keyValue field
  /// corresponds in order to the parameter value in the key field.
  ///
  /// For interpolator nodes that produce a single value, results are
  /// undefined if the number of values in the key field is not the same as
  /// the number of values in the keyValue field.
  ///
  /// For Interpolator nodes that produce multiple values, the keyValue
  /// field is an nxm array of values, where n is the number of values in
  /// the key field and m is the number of values at each key frame. Each m
  /// values in the keyValue field correspond, in order, to a parameter
  /// value in the key field. Each value_changed event shall contain m
  /// interpolated values. Results are undefined if the number of values in
  /// the keyValue field is not a positive integer multiple of the number of
  /// values in the key field.
  ///
  /// If an X3DInterpolatorNode value_changed outputOnly field is read
  /// before it receives any inputs, keyValue[0] is returned if keyValue is
  /// not empty. If keyValue is empty (i.e., [ ]), the initial value for the
  /// respective field type is returned (EXAMPLE (0, 0, 0) for SFVec3f); see
  /// 5 Field type reference for initial event values.
  ///
  /// The location of an X3DInterpolatorNode in the transformation hierarchy
  /// has no effect on its operation. For example, if a parent of an
  /// interpolator node is a Switch node with whichChoice set to 1 (i.e.,
  /// ignore its children), the interpolator continues to operate as
  /// specified (receives and sends events).
  ///
  /// A typical simplified structure for a key frame animation
  /// implementation involves a TimeSensor, ROUTEs, and the target node.
  ///
  ///  Transform { 
  ///    Shape 
  ///       IndexedFaceSet { coordIndex='... 1 ... >
  ///           Coordinate DEF='Moved' point [ x y z, ... ] # t0Geometry
  ///       }                  
  ///    }
  ///  } 
  ///
  /// CoordinateInterpolator DEF='Mover'
  ///    key [t0 t1 t2 ]            #   list of key times, 0 to 1
  ///    keyValue ' x y z, ... '    #   one geometry per key time
  ///
  /// TimeSensor DEF='Timer' cycleInterval 5 loop TRUE 
  ///
  /// ROUTE Timer.fraction_changed TO Mover.set_value  
  /// ROUTE Mover.value_changed TO Moved.point 
  ///
  /// In typical operation, the key frame set_fraction event arrives from a
  /// TimeSensor to signal that the time value has advanced. This value varies
  /// from 0 to 1 depending upon where the TimeSensor is in its cycle time.
  /// For example, if the TimeSensor has a cycleTime of 10 seconds, and 5
  /// seconds has elapsed in its cycle, the set_fraction value will be 0.5.
  ///
  /// In this sample structure, the IndexedFaceSet contains a Coordinate field
  /// named Moved. This defines the time equals zero geometry for the node.
  /// The CoordinateInterpolator node named Mover contains the list of key
  /// frame times and the corresponding sets of coordinates in the keyValue
  /// field. When the set_fraction event arrives for key, the corresponding 
  /// interpolated keyValue is sent to the target Coordinate node for
  /// rendering.
