  /// \class CylinderSensor
  /// \brief The CylinderSensor node maps pointer motion
  /// (e.g., a mouse or wand) into a rotation on an invisible cylinder that
  /// is aligned with the Y-axis of the local sensor coordinate system.
  ///
  /// The local sensor coordinate system is created by applying the
  /// axisRotation field value to the local coordinate system. The
  /// CylinderSensor uses the descendent geometry of its parent node to
  /// determine whether it is liable to generate events.
  ///
  /// The description field in the CylinderSensor node specifies a textual
  /// description of the CylinderSensor node. This may be used by
  /// browser-specific user interfaces that wish to present users with more
  /// detailed information about the CylinderSensor.
  ///
  /// The enabled field enables and disables the CylinderSensor node. If TRUE,
  /// the sensor reacts appropriately to user events. If FALSE, the sensor does
  /// not track user input or send events. If enabled receives a FALSE event
  /// and isActive is TRUE, the sensor becomes disabled and deactivated, and
  /// outputs an isActive FALSE event. If enabled receives a TRUE event the
  /// sensor is enabled and ready for user activation.
  ///
  /// A CylinderSensor node generates events when the pointing device is
  /// activated while the pointer is indicating any descendent geometry nodes
  /// of the sensor's parent group. Activating and manipulating
  /// pointing device sensors, for more details on using the pointing device
  /// to activate the CylinderSensor.
  ///
  /// Upon activation of the pointing device while indicating the sensor's
  /// geometry, an isActive TRUE event is sent. The initial acute angle between
  /// the bearing vector and the local sensor coordinate system Y-axis of the
  /// CylinderSensor node determines whether the sides of the invisible
  /// cylinder or the caps (disks) are used for manipulation. If the initial
  /// angle is less than the diskAngle, the geometry is treated as an
  /// infinitely large disk lying in Y=0 plane of the local sensor coordinate
  /// system and coincident with the initial intersection point. Dragging
  /// motion is mapped into a rotation around the +Y-axis vector of the local
  /// sensor coordinate system. The perpendicular vector from the initial
  /// intersection point to the Y-axis defines zero rotation about the Y-axis
  /// of the local sensor coordinate system. For each subsequent position of
  /// the bearing, a rotation_changed event is sent that equals the sum of the
  /// rotation about the +Y-axis vector of the local sensor coordinate system
  /// (from the initial intersection to the new intersection) plus the offset
  /// value. trackPoint_changed events reflect the unclamped drag position on
  /// the surface of this disk. When the pointing device is deactivated and
  /// autoOffset is TRUE, offset is set to the last value of rotation_changed
  /// and an offset_changed event is generated.
  ///
  /// If the initial acute angle between the bearing vector and the local
  /// sensor coordinate system Y-axis of the CylinderSensor node is greater
  /// than or equal to diskAngle, then the sensor behaves like a cylinder. The
  /// shortest distance between the point of intersection (between the bearing
  /// and the sensor's geometry) and the Y-axis of the parent group's local
  /// coordinate system determines the radius of an invisible cylinder used to
  /// map pointing device motion and marks the zero rotation value. For each
  /// subsequent position of the bearing, a rotation_changed event is sent that
  /// equals the sum of the right-handed rotation from the original
  /// intersection about the +Y-axis vector plus the offset value.
  /// trackPoint_changed events reflect the unclamped drag position on the
  /// surface of the invisible cylinder. When the pointing device is
  /// deactivated and autoOffset is TRUE, offset is set to the last rotation
  /// angle and an offset_changed event is generated.
  ///
  /// When the sensor generates an isActive TRUE event, it grabs all further
  /// motion events from the pointing device until it is released and generates
  /// an isActive FALSE event (other pointing-device sensors shall not generate
  /// events during this time). Motion of the pointing device while isActive is
  /// TRUE is referred to as a "drag" operation. If a 2D pointing device is in
  /// use, isActive events will typically reflect the state of the primary
  /// button associated with the device (i.e., isActive is TRUE when the
  /// primary button is pressed and FALSE when it is released). If a 3D
  /// pointing device (e.g., a wand) is in use, isActive events will typically
  /// reflect whether the pointer is within or in contact with the sensor's
  /// geometry.
  ///
  /// While the pointing device is activated, trackPoint_changed and
  /// rotation_changed events are output and are interpreted from pointing
  /// device motion based on the sensor's local coordinate system at the time
  /// of activation. trackPoint_changed events represent the unclamped
  /// intersection points on the surface of the invisible cylinder or disk.
  /// If the initial angle results in cylinder rotation (as opposed to disk
  /// behaviour) and if the pointing device is dragged off the cylinder while
  /// activated, browsers may interpret this in a variety of ways (e.g., clamp
  /// all values to the cylinder and continuing to rotate as the point is
  /// dragged away from the cylinder). Each movement of the pointing device
  /// while isActive is TRUE generates trackPoint_changed and rotation_changed
  /// events.
  ///
  /// The minAngle and maxAngle fields clamp rotation_changed events to a range
  /// of values. If minAngle is greater than maxAngle, rotation_changed events
  /// are not clamped. The minAngle and maxAngle fields are restricted to the
  /// range [-2pi, 2pi].
  ///
