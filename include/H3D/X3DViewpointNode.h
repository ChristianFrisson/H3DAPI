  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class X3DViewpointNode
  /// \brief The X3DViewpointNode node defines a specific location in the local 
  /// coordinate system from which the user may view the scene. 
  ///
  /// X3DViewpointNode nodes are bindable children nodes (see X3DBindableNode)
  /// and thus there exists a X3DViewpointNode node stack in which the top-most 
  /// X3DViewpointNode node on the stack is the currently active
  /// X3DViewpointNode node. If a TRUE value is sent to the set_bind field of a
  /// X3DViewpointNode node, it is moved to the top of the X3DViewpointNode
  /// node stack and activated. When a X3DViewpointNode node is at the top of
  /// the stack, the user's view is conceptually re-parented as a child of the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node. All subsequent changes to the X3DViewpointNode
  /// node's coordinate system change the user's view (e.g., changes to any
  /// ancestor transformation nodes or to the X3DViewpointNode node's position
  /// or orientation fields). Sending a set_bind FALSE event removes the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node from the stack and produces isBound FALSE and
  /// bindTime events. If the popped X3DViewpointNode node is at the top of the
  /// X3DViewpointNode stack, the user's view is re-parented to the next entry
  /// in the stack. When a X3DViewpointNode node is moved to the top of the
  /// stack, the existing top of stack X3DViewpointNode node sends an isBound
  /// FALSE event and is pushed down the stack.
  ///
  /// An author can automatically move the user's view through the world by
  /// binding the user to a X3DViewpointNode node and then animating either the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node or the transformations above it. 
  /// The bindTime field sends the time at which the X3DViewpointNode node is
  /// bound or unbound. This can happen:
  ///
  /// - during loading.
  /// - when a set_bind event is sent to the X3DViewpointNode node;
  /// - when the browser binds to the X3DViewpointNode node through its user
  ///   interface described below.
  ///
  /// The position and orientation fields of the X3DViewpointNode node specify
  /// relative locations in the local coordinate system. Position is
  /// relative to the coordinate system's origin (0,0,0), while orientation
  /// specifies a rotation relative to the default orientation. In the
  /// default position and orientation, the viewer is on the Z-axis looking
  /// down the Z-axis toward the origin with +X to the right and +Y straight
  /// up. X3DViewpointNode nodes are affected by the transformation hierarchy.
  ///
  /// Navigation types (see NavigationInfo) that require a definition
  /// of a down vector (e.g., terrain following) shall use the negative
  /// Y-axis of the coordinate system of the currently bound X3DViewpointNode
  /// node. Likewise, navigation types that require a definition of an up
  /// vector shall use the positive Y-axis of the coordinate system of the
  /// currently bound X3DViewpointNode node. The orientation field of the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node does not affect the definition of the down or up
  /// vectors. This allows the author to separate the viewing direction from
  /// the gravity direction.
  ///
  /// The jump field specifies whether the user's view "jumps" to the
  /// position and orientation of a bound X3DViewpointNode node or remains
  /// unchanged. This jump is instantaneous and discontinuous in that no
  /// collisions are performed and no ProximitySensor nodes are checked in
  /// between the starting and ending jump points. If the user's position
  /// before the jump is inside a ProximitySensor the exitTime of that
  /// sensor shall send the same timestamp as the bind field. Similarly, if
  /// the user's position after the jump is inside a ProximitySensor the
  /// enterTime of that sensor shall send the same timestamp as the bind
  /// field. Regardless of the value of jump at bind time, the relative
  /// viewing transformation between the user's view and the current
  /// X3DViewpointNode node shall be stored with the current X3DViewpointNode
  /// node for later use when un-jumping (i.e., popping the X3DViewpointNode
  /// node binding stack from a X3DViewpointNode node with jump TRUE). The
  /// following summarizes the bind stack rules (X3DBindableNode) with
  /// additional rules regarding X3DViewpointNode nodes:
  /// <ul>
  /// <li>
  /// During read, the first encountered X3DViewpointNode node is bound by
  /// pushing it to the top of the X3DViewpointNode node stack. If a
  /// X3DViewpointNode node name is specified in the URL that is being read,
  /// this named X3DViewpointNode node is considered to be the first
  /// encountered X3DViewpointNode node. Nodes contained within Inline nodes
  /// (see 9.4.2 Inline), within the strings passed to the
  /// Browser.createX3DFromString() method, or within files passed to
  /// the Browser.createX3DFromURL() method (see 2.[I19775-2]) are not
  /// candidates for the first encountered X3DViewpointNode node. The first
  /// node within a prototype instance is a valid candidate for the first
  /// encountered X3DViewpointNode node. The first encountered X3DViewpointNode
  /// node sends an isBound TRUE event.
  /// <li>
  /// When a set_bind TRUE event is received by a X3DViewpointNode node,
  /// <ol><li>
  /// If it is not on the top of the stack: The relative transformation from
  /// the current top of stack X3DViewpointNode node to the user's view is
  /// stored with the current top of stack X3DViewpointNode node. The current
  /// top of stack node sends an isBound FALSE event. The new node is moved to
  /// the top of the stack and becomes the currently bound X3DViewpointNode
  /// node. The new X3DViewpointNode node (top of stack) sends an isBound TRUE
  /// event. If jump is TRUE for the new X3DViewpointNode node, the user's view
  /// is instantaneously "jumped" to match the values in the position and
  /// orientation fields of the new X3DViewpointNode node.
  /// <li> If the node is already at the top of the stack, this event has
  /// no effect.
  /// </ol>
  /// <li>
  /// When a set_bind FALSE event is received by a X3DViewpointNode node in the
  /// stack, it is removed from the stack. If it was on the top of the
  /// stack,
  /// - it sends an isBound FALSE event.
  /// - The next node in the stack becomes the currently bound X3DViewpointNode
  ///   node and issues an isBound TRUE event.
  /// - if its jump field value is TRUE, the user's view is instantaneously
  ///   "jumped" to the position and orientation of the next X3DViewpointNode
  ///   node in the stack with the stored relative transformation of this next
  ///   X3DViewpointNode node applied.
  /// <li>
  /// If a set_bind FALSE event is received by a node not in the stack, the
  /// event is ignored and isBound events are not sent.
  /// <li>
  /// When a node replaces another node at the top of the stack, the isBound
  /// TRUE and FALSE events from the two nodes are sent simultaneously
  /// (i.e., with identical timestamps).
  /// <li>
  /// If a bound node is deleted, it behaves as if it received a set_bind
  /// FALSE event (see c. above).
  /// </ul>
  /// 
  /// The jump field may change after a X3DViewpointNode node is bound. The
  /// rules described above still apply. If jump was TRUE when the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node is bound, but changed to FALSE before the set_bind
  /// FALSE is sent, the X3DViewpointNode node does not un-jump during unbind.
  /// If jump was FALSE when the X3DViewpointNode node is bound, but changed to
  /// TRUE before the set_bind FALSE is sent, the X3DViewpointNode node does
  /// perform the un-jump during unbind.
  ///
  /// Note that there are two other mechanisms that result in the binding of
  /// a new X3DViewpointNode:
  ///
  /// - An Anchor node's url field specifies a "#X3DViewpointNodeName".
  /// - A script invokes the loadURL() method and the URL argument specifies a
  ///   "#X3DViewpointNodeName".
  ///
  /// Both of these mechanisms override the jump field value of the
  /// specified X3DViewpointNode node (#X3DViewpointNodeName) and assume that
  /// jump is TRUE when binding to the new X3DViewpointNode. The behaviour of
  /// the viewer transition to the newly bound X3DViewpointNode depends on the
  /// currently bound NavigationInfo node's type field value.
  ///
  /// \anchor X3DViewpointNode_fieldOfView
  /// The fieldOfView field specifies a preferred minimum viewing angle from
  /// this X3DViewpointNode in radians. A small field of view roughly
  /// corresponds to a telephoto lens; a large field of view roughly
  /// corresponds to a wide-angle lens. The field of view shall be greater than
  /// zero and smaller than ?. The value of fieldOfView represents the minimum
  /// viewing angle in any direction axis perpendicular to the view. For
  /// example, a browser with a rectangular viewing projection shall have
  /// the following relationship:
  ///
  ///   display width    tan(FOVhorizontal/2) \n
  ///   -------------- = -----------------    \n
  ///   display height   tan(FOVvertical/2)   \n
  ///
  /// where the smaller of display width or display height determines which
  /// angle equals the fieldOfView (the larger angle is computed using the
  /// relationship described above). The larger angle shall not exceed ? and
  /// may force the smaller angle to be less than fieldOfView in order to
  /// sustain the aspect ratio.
  ///
  /// The description field specifies a textual description of the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node. This may be used by browser-specific user
  /// interfaces. If a X3DViewpointNode's description field is empty it is
  /// recommended that the browser not present this X3DViewpointNode in its
  /// browser-specific user interface.
  ///
  /// The centerOfRotation field specifies a center about which to rotate
  /// the user's eyepoint when in EXAMINE mode. If the browser does not
  /// provide the ability to spin around the object in EXAMINE mode, or
  /// LOOKAT is not in the list of allowed navigation modes, this field
  /// shall be ignored.
  ///
  /// The URL syntax ".../scene.wrl#X3DViewpointNodeName" specifies the user's 
  /// initial view when loading "scene.wrl" to be the first X3DViewpointNode
  /// node in the X3D file that appears as DEF X3DViewpointNodeName
  /// X3DViewpointNode {...}. This overrides the first X3DViewpointNode node
  /// in the X3D file as the initial user view, and a set_bind TRUE message is
  /// sent to the X3DViewpointNode node named "X3DViewpointNodeName". If the
  /// X3DViewpointNode node named "X3DViewpointNodeName" is not found, the
  /// browser shall use the first X3DViewpointNode node in the X3D file (i.e.
  /// the normal default behaviour). The URL syntax "#X3DViewpointNodeName"
  /// (i.e. no file name) specifies a X3DViewpointNode within the existing X3D
  /// file. If this URL is loaded (e.g. Anchor node's url field or loadURL()
  /// method is invoked by a Script node), the X3DViewpointNode node named
  /// "X3DViewpointNodeName" is bound (a set_bind TRUE event is sent to this
  /// X3DViewpointNode node).
  ///
  /// The retainUserOffsets field indicates whether a viewpoint needs to retain
  /// (TRUE) or reset to zero (FALSE) any prior user navigation offsets from
  /// defined viewpoint position, orientation. When an node of type
  /// X3DViewpointNode is bound, user navigation offsets are reinitialized if
  /// the associated retainUserOffsets is TRUE.
