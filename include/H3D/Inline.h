  /// \brief The Inline node embeds an X3D scene stored at a location on
  /// the World Wide Web into the current scene. 
  ///
  /// The Inline node embeds an X3D scene stored at a location on the World
  /// Wide Web into the current scene. Exactly when the Inline scene is read
  /// and displayed is defined by the value of the load field, in profiles
  /// that support that field. In profiles that do not support the load
  /// field, exactly when the scene is read and displayed is not defined
  /// (e.g. reading the scene may be delayed until the Inline node's
  /// bounding box is visible to the viewer). Once the Inline scene is
  /// loaded, its children are added to the current scene and are treated as
  /// children of the Inline for rendering and interaction; however the
  /// children are not exposed to the current scene for routing and DEF name
  /// access unless their names have been explicitly imported into the scene
  /// using the IMPORT statement (see 4.4.6.2 IMPORT semantics).
  ///
  /// Each specified URL shall refer to a valid X3D file that contains a
  /// list of children nodes, prototypes and routes at the top level as
  /// described in 10.2.1 Grouping and children node types. The results are
  /// undefined if the URL refers to a file that is not an X3D file, or if
  /// the X3D file contains an invalid scene.
  ///
  /// It shall be an error to specify a file in the URL field that has a set
  /// of component definitions that is not a subset of the components of the
  /// containing world. In addition, the components shall not be of a higher
  /// support level than those used by the containing world, either
  /// implicitly or through the PROFILE declaration or additional COMPONENT
  /// statements. When an inlined world requests capabilities greater than
  /// its parent, the following actions shall occur:
  ///
  ///  - an error shall be generated, 
  ///  - the URL shall be treated as not interpretable as specified in
  ///    9.3.2 X3DUrlObject, and  
  ///  - the next URL shall be loaded and checked in accordance with 9.2
  ///    Concepts.  
  ///
  /// If the load field is set to TRUE (the default field value), the X3D
  /// file specified by the url field is loaded immediately. If the load
  /// field is set to FALSE, no action is taken. It is possible to
  /// explicitly load the URL at a later time by sending a TRUE event to the
  /// load field (e.g., as the result of a ProximitySensor or other sensor
  /// firing an event). If a FALSE event is sent to the load field of a
  /// previously loaded Inline, the contents of the Inline will be unloaded
  /// from the scene graph.
  ///
  /// An event sent to url can be used to change the scene that is inlined
  /// by the Inline node. If this value is set after the Inline is already
  /// loaded, its contents will be unloaded and the scene to which the new
  /// URL points will be loaded.
  ///
  /// The user is able to specify a bounding box for the Inline node using
  /// the bboxCenter and bboxSize fields. This is a hint to the browser and
  /// could be used for optimization purposes such as culling.
