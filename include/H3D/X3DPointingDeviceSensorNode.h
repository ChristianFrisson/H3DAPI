  /// \ingroup AbstractNodes
  /// \class X3DPointingDeviceSensorNode
  /// \brief This abstract node type is the base type for all 
  /// pointing device sensors.
  ///
  /// Pointing-device sensors detect user pointing events such as the user
  /// clicking on a piece of geometry (i.e., TouchSensor). The following node
  /// types are pointing-device sensors:
  /// <ul>
  /// <li>CylinderSensor</a></li>
  /// <li>PlaneSensor</a></li>
  /// <li>SphereSensor</a></li>
  /// <li>TouchSensor</a></li>
  /// </ul>
  ///
  /// A pointing-device sensor is activated when the user locates the pointing
  /// device over geometry that is influenced by that specific pointing-device
  /// sensor. Pointing-device sensors have influence over all geometry that is
  /// descended from the sensor's parent groups. Typically, the pointing-device
  /// sensor is a sibling to the geometry that it influences. In other cases,
  /// the sensor is a sibling to groups which contain geometry
  /// (i.e., are influenced by the pointing-device sensor).
  ///
  /// The appearance properties of the geometry do not affect activation of the
  /// sensor. In particular, transparent materials or textures shall be treated
  /// as opaque with respect to activation of pointing-device sensors.
  ///
  /// For a given user activation, the lowest enabled pointing-device sensor in
  /// the hierarchy is activated. All other pointing-device sensors above the
  /// lowest enabled pointing-device sensor are ignored. The hierarchy is
  /// defined by the geometry node over which the pointing-device sensor is
  /// located and the entire hierarchy upward. If there are multiple
  /// pointing-device sensors tied for lowest, each of these is activated
  /// simultaneously and independently, possibly resulting in multiple sensors
  /// activating and generating output simultaneously. This feature allows
  /// combinations of pointing-device sensors
  /// (e.g., TouchSensor and PlaneSensor). If a pointing-device sensor appears
  /// in the transformation hierarchy multiple times (DEF/USE), it shall be
  /// tested for activation in all of the coordinate systems in which it
  /// appears.
  ///
  /// If a pointing-device sensor is not enabled when the pointing-device
  /// button is activated, it will not generate events related to the pointing
  /// device until after the pointing device is deactivated and the sensor is
  /// enabled (i.e., enabling a sensor in the middle of dragging does not
  /// result in the sensor activating immediately).
  ///
  /// The pointing device controls a pointer in the virtual world. While 
  /// activated by the pointing device, a sensor will generate events as 
  /// the pointer moves. Typically the pointing device may be categorized as 
  /// either 2D (e.g., conventional mouse) or 3D (e.g., wand). It is suggested
  /// that the pointer controlled by a 2D device is mapped onto a plane a fixed
  /// distance from the viewer and perpendicular to the line of sight. The
  /// mapping of a 3D device may describe a 1:1 relationship between movement
  /// of the pointing device and movement of the pointer.
  ///
  /// The position of the pointer defines a bearing which is used to determine
  /// which geometry is being indicated. When implementing a 2D pointing device
  /// it is suggested that the bearing is defined by the vector from the viewer
  /// position through the location of the pointer. When implementing a 3D
  /// pointing device it is suggested that the bearing is defined by extending
  /// a vector from the current position of the pointer in the direction
  /// indicated by the pointer. 
  ///
  /// In all cases the pointer is considered to be indicating a specific
  /// geometry when that geometry is intersected by the bearing. If the bearing
  /// intersects multiple sensors' geometries, only the sensor nearest to the
  /// pointer will be eligible for activation.
  /// \par Internal routes:
  /// \dotfile X3DPointingDeviceSensorNode.dot
  // TODO: Allowing for 3D pointing device.
