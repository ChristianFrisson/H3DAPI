  /// \class ParticleSystem
  /// \brief The ParticleSystem node specifies a complete particle system.
  ///
  /// The geometryType field specifies the type of geometry that should be 
  /// used to represent individual particles. Typically, a particle is 
  /// calculated as a point in space at which the geometry is placed and then
  /// rendered using the appearance attributes.
  ///
  /// The types of geometry are defined to render in the following way:
  /// - "LINE":  A line is drawn along the particle's current velocity vector,
  /// for this frame, centered about the particle's position. The length of the
  /// line is specified by the particle's height from the particleSize field 
  /// value.
  /// - "POINT":  A point geometry is rendered at the particle's position.
  /// - "QUAD":  A 2D quad is rendered aligned in the local coordinate space 
  /// of the particle system with the face normal pointing along the positive
  /// Z axis. Individual quads are not aligned to the user's eye position but
  /// are effected in depth by the physics model. The particle's position is at
  /// the center of the quad.
  /// - "SPRITE":  A point sprite that uses a 2D point position to locate a
  /// screen-aligned quad at the center of the particle's location is rendered.
  /// - "TRIANGLE":  A 2D quad is rendered using a pair of triangles aligned in
  /// the local coordinate space of the particle system with the face normal
  /// pointing along the positive Z axis. Individual triangles are not aligned
  /// to the user's eye position, but are effected in depth by the physics model.
  /// The particle's position is at the center of the triangle.
  /// - "GEOMETRY":  The geometry specified by the geometry field is rendered 
  /// for each particle using the local coordinate system. Changing the value
  /// of the geometry field or the definition of the geometry node shall take
  /// effect this frame.
  ///
  /// The geometry field specifies the geometry to be used for each particle
  /// when the geometryType field has value "GEOMETRY".
  ///
  /// The appearance field holds information that is used for the geometry. All
  /// effects, such as material colours and/or multi-textures, are applied to 
  /// each particle. If a texture coordinate ramp and key is supplied with this
  /// geometry, it shall be used in preference to any automatic texture 
  /// coordinate generation. If automatic texture coordinate generation is 
  /// used, results shall be based on the entire volume that the particles 
  /// consume, not locally applied to each particle.
  ///
  /// Procedural shaders may also be supplied. The particle system shall manage
  /// the position of all particles each frame. This position becomes the 
  /// initial geometry input to the shader.
  ///
  /// The emitter field specifies the type of emitter geometry and properties 
  /// that the particles are given for their initial positions. After being 
  /// created, the individual particles are then manipulated according to the
  /// physics model(s) specified in the physics field.
  ///
  /// The colorRamp and colorKey fields specify how to change the base colour
  /// of the particle over the lifetime of an individual particle. The colorKey
  /// field represents the time of the particle in seconds, while the colorRamp
  /// field holds a series of colour values to be used at the given key points
  /// in time. Between keys, colour values are interpreted in a linear HSV 
  /// space, using the same rules defined for the ColorInterpolator node. The
  /// colour values are defined as per-vertex colour values. Consequently, if 
  /// an appearance node with material is provided, the material properties 
  /// will override the colour ramp.
  ///
  /// The isActive outputOnly field indicates whether the particle system is
  /// currently running, based on the setup of the node.
  ///
  /// The isActive field sends a value of FALSE when activity has stopped 
  /// occurring. A particle system without an emitter set can never be active.
  /// If the emitter is defined by an EXTERNPROTO that has not yet resolved, 
  /// isActive shall initially be FALSE, until the point the EXTERNPROTO has 
  /// loaded and is verified as being a correct node type. If these validity 
  /// checks pass, isActive is set to TRUE and this defines the local time zero
  /// to start the particle effects.
  ///
  /// The enabled field controls whether this ParticleSystem is currently 
  /// active and rendering particles this frame. Setting this value to FALSE
  /// will immediately remove all visible particles from the scene from the
  /// next frame onwards. Setting the field to TRUE will start the system again
  /// from a local time zero. It does not start off from where it was 
  /// previously. In doing so, it will issue another value of TRUE for 
  /// isActive. If a value of FALSE is set for enabled, isActive will also be
  /// set to FALSE. 
  ///
  /// The createParticles field is used to control whether any further new 
  /// particles should be created. This allows the user to stop production
  /// of new particles, but keep those already existing in the scene to 
  /// continue to animate. This differs from the enabled field that would
  /// immediately remove all particles. The createParticles field keeps the
  /// existing particles in existence until the end of their lifetimes. If
  /// there are no particles left in the scene, the system is still considered
  /// both active and enabled.
  ///
  /// The particleSize field describes the dimensions in metres of the width
  /// and height of each particle. Changing this value dynamically will only
  /// change new particles created after the change. Particles created before
  /// this timestamp will remain at the old size. This field only effects
  /// particles using "LINE", "QUAD", "SPRITE", and "TRIANGLE" geometry types.
  ///
  /// The texCoordRamp and texCoordKey fields control the texture coordinates
  /// of the provided texture(s) in the Appearance node, over time. Particle
  /// systems frequently like to change the texture on a particle as it ages,
  /// yet there is no good way of accomplishing this through standard
  /// interpolators because interpolators have no concept of particle time. 
  /// This pair of fields hold time-dependent values for the texture 
  /// coordinates to be applied to the particle. When a particle reaches the
  /// next time stamp it moves to the next set of texture coordinates. There
  /// is no interpolation of the texture coordinates, just sequenced according
  /// to the times defined by texCoordKey.
  ///
  /// The node placed in texCoordRamp shall have enough values to work with 
  /// the numbers required by geometryType. The following numbers and rules
  /// for mapping texture coordinates to the quad shall be used:
  /// - "LINE": The coordinates are paired such that the coordinate with
  /// lowest value index is associated with the end of the line that is
  /// closest to the emitter location and the coordinate with the next 
  /// higher index is associated with the end of the line furthest from
  /// the emitter location. Each timestamp increases the index into the ramp
  /// by two.
  /// - "POINT": Texture coordinates are ignored.
  /// - "QUAD":  Assuming a quad facing the current viewer position, 
  /// coordinates are defined in a counter-clockwise order starting at the
  /// lower-left corner.
  /// - "SPRITE": Texture coordinates are ignored for this type. Each 
  /// particle uses the entire supplied texture.
  /// - "TRIANGLE": Assuming two triangles facing the user, only four 
  /// coordinates are supplied, representing the four corners of the
  /// quad. The order is the same as for "QUAD".
  /// - "GEOMETRY": Texture coordinates ramps are ignored for this type.
  /// Texture coordinates from the geometry representation are used or 
  /// automatic texture coordinate generation from the appearance node
  /// is used.
  ///
