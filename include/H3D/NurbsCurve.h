  /// \brief The NurbsCurve node is a geometry node defining a parametric
  ///  curve in 3D space.
  ///
  ///  The tessellation field gives a hint to the curve tessellator by
  ///  setting an absolute number of subdivision steps. These values shall
  ///  be greater than or equal to the Order field. A value of 0 indicates
  ///  that the browser choose a suitable tessellation. Interpretation of 
  ///  values below 0 is implementation dependent.
  ///
  ///  For an implementation subdividing the surface into an equal number
  ///  of subdivision steps, tessellation values are interpreted as follows:
  ///  
  ///  - if a tessellation value is greater than 0, the number of tessellation
  ///  points is:
  ///  tessellation+1;
  /// 
  ///  - if a tessellation value is smaller than 0, the number of tessellation
  ///  points is:
  ///   -tessellation *(number of control points)+1;
  ///
  ///  - if a tessellation value is 0, the number of tessellation points is:
  ///  (2 * (number of control points)+1. 
  /// 
  ///  For implementations doing tessellations based on chord length, 
  ///  tessellation values less than zero are interpreted as the maximum 
  ///  chord length deviation in pixels. Implementations doing fully automatic
  ///  tessellation may ignore the tessellation hint parameters.
