  /// \ingroup AbstractNodes
  /// \class X3DBackgroundNode
  /// \brief X3DBackgroundNode is the abstract type from which all 
  /// backgrounds inherit. X3DBackgroundNode is a bindable node that when
  /// bound to defines the panoramic background for the scene.
  ///
  /// Background nodes are used to specify a colour backdrop that simulates
  /// ground and sky, as well as a background texture, or panorama, that is
  /// placed behind all geometry in the scene and in front of the ground and
  /// sky. Background nodes are specified in the local coordinate system and
  /// are affected by the accumulated rotation of their ancestors as described
  /// below. X3D supports two kinds of background nodes: a simple background 
  /// node that contains a set of url fields for specifying static image files
  /// that compose the backdrop (see Background), and a complex background
  /// node containing arbitrary X3DTextureNode nodes that compose the backdrop
  /// (see TextureBackground). Both types of background node descend from the
  /// base type X3DBackgroundNode. Applications should use the Background
  /// node for simplicity, and the TextureBackground node for more 
  /// flexibility and additional features.
  ///
  /// Background nodes are bindable nodes. There exists a Background stack,
  /// in which the top-most Background on the stack is the currently active
  /// Background. To move a Background to the top of the stack, a TRUE value
  /// is sent to the set_bind field. Once active, the Background is then
  /// bound to the browsers view. A FALSE value sent to set_bind removes
  /// the Background from the stack and unbinds it from the browser's view.
  ///
  /// The backdrop is conceptually a partial sphere (the ground) enclosed 
  /// inside of a full sphere (the sky) in the local coordinate system with 
  /// the viewer placed at the centre of the spheres. Both spheres have
  /// infinite radius and each is painted with concentric circles of 
  /// interpolated colour perpendicular to the local Y-axis of the sphere. 
  /// The Background node is subject to the accumulated rotations of its 
  /// ancestors' transformations. Scaling and translation transformations are
  /// ignored. The sky sphere is always slightly farther away from the viewer
  /// than the ground partial sphere causing the ground to appear in front of
  /// the sky where they overlap.
  ///
  /// The skyColor field specifies the colour of the sky at various angles on
  /// the sky sphere. The first value of the skyColor field specifies the 
  /// colour of the sky at 0.0 radians representing the zenith (i.e., 
  /// straight up from the viewer). The skyAngle field specifies the angles
  /// from the zenith in which concentric circles of colour appear. The zenith
  /// of the sphere is implicitly defined to be 0.0 radians, the natural 
  /// horizon is at pi/2 radians, and the nadir (i.e., straight down from the
  /// viewer) is at pi radians. skyAngle is restricted to non-decreasing
  /// values in the range [0.0, pi]. There shall be one more skyColor value
  /// than there are skyAngle values. The first colour value is the colour at
  /// the zenith, which is not specified in the skyAngle field. If the last
  /// skyAngle is less than pi, then the colour band between the last skyAngle
  /// and the nadir is clamped to the last skyColor. The sky colour is
  /// linearly interpolated between the specified skyColor values.
  ///
  /// The groundColor field specifies the colour of the ground at the
  /// various angles on the ground partial sphere. The first value of the
  /// groundColor field specifies the colour of the ground at 0.0 radians
  /// representing the nadir (i.e., straight down from the user). The 
  /// groundAngle field specifies the angles from the nadir that the 
  /// concentric circles of colour appear. The nadir of the sphere is 
  /// implicitly defined at 0.0 radians. groundAngle is restricted to 
  /// non-decreasing values in the range [0.0, pi/2]. There shall be one more
  /// groundColor value than there are groundAngle values. The first colour
  /// value is for the nadir which is not specified in the groundAngle field.
  /// If the last groundAngle is less than pi/2, the region between the last
  /// groundAngle and the equator is non-existant. The ground colour is 
  /// linearly interpolated between the specified groundColor values.
  ///
  /// Ground colours, sky colours, and panoramic images do not translate
  /// with respect to the viewer, though they do rotate with respect to the
  /// viewer. That is, the viewer can never get any closer to the background,
  /// but can turn to examine all sides of the panorama cube, and can look 
  /// up and down to see the concentric rings of ground and sky (if visible).
  ///
  /// Background nodes are not affected by Fog nodes. Therefore, if a 
  /// Background node is active (i.e., bound) while a Fog node is active,
  /// then the Background node will be displayed with no fogging effects. 
  /// It is the author's responsibility to set the Background values to match
  /// the Fog values (e.g.  ground colours fade to fog colour with 
  /// distance and panorama images tinted with fog colour). Background nodes
  /// are not affected by light sources.
