  /// All nodes under a Switch continue to receive and send events

  /// TimeSensor sends events regardless of the Switch's state.

  /// bounding box is smaller than the actual bounding box of the child with
  /// the largest bounding box at any time. A default bboxSize value, (-1,
  /// -1, -1), implies that the bounding box is not specified and, if
  /// needed, is calculated by the browser.
