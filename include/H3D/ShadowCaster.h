  /// \class ShadowCaster
  /// The ShadowCaster node uses shadow volumes using stencil buffer
  /// to cast shadows from objects in a scene. 
  ///
  /// NOTE! Do not use this node unless you really need to. If you 
  /// just want to use shadows please use the shadow field in the 
  /// Appearance node for a much easier way of adding shadows.
  ///
  /// The object field specifies objects that should cast shadows.
  ///
  /// The light field specifies the lights from which the objects
  /// should cast shadows.
  ///
  /// The shadowDarkness field specifies how dark the shadow should be
  /// with 1 being totally black.
  /// 
  /// The algorithm field defines what shadow volume algorithm to use.
  /// Possible values are "ZPASS" and "ZFAIL". 
  /// Both have their pros and cons:
  /// - ZPASS is faster, but is not robust in all cases and fails 
  /// if the viewer is in shadow.
  /// - ZFAIL is slower, but more robust. To make it work properly 
  /// the far clip plane has to be set to infinity(done by setting 
  /// visibilityLimit to -1 in NavigationInfo). This will decrease
  /// the precision of the depth buffer, with all the problems
  /// that comes with that.
  ///
  ///  The shadowDepthOffset field controls the z offset of drawn 
  /// shadow volumes. The z offset will be r * defaultShadowDepthOffset
  /// where r is the smallest value that is guaranteed to produce a 
  /// resolvable z offset for a given implementation. If this value is
  /// set to too small there will be z-fighting between shadow and object
  /// that casts the shadow(flickering). If this happens increase this value.
  /// The value needed depends on the precision of the depth buffer.
  ///
  ///
  /// The ShadowCaster node is affected by the transform hierarchy
  /// that it is in and all objects and lighs are specified in 
  /// local coordinates.
  ///
