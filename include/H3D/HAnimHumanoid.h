  /// \brief The HAnimHumanoid node is a container for the entire humanoid.
	///
	/// In addition it is used to store human-readable data such
	/// as author and copyright information, as well as to store references to
	/// the HAnimJoint, HAnimSegment, and HAnimSite nodes in addition to serving
	/// as a container for the entire humanoid. Thus, it serves as a central node
	/// for moving the humanoid through its environment.
	/// 
	/// \note This nodes functionality is not fully implemented, only joints are used.
	///
	/// <b>Examples:</b>
  ///   - <a href="../../../H3DAPI/examples/All/BoxMan.x3d">BoxMan.x3d</a>
