  /// \ingroup AbstractNodes
  /// \class VisibilitySensor
  /// \brief  The VisibilitySensor node detects visibility changes of a
  ///  rectangular box as the user navigates the world. VisibilitySensor
  ///  is typically used to detect when the user can see a specific object
  ///  or region in the scene in order to activate or deactivate some 
  ///  behaviour or animation. The purpose is often to attract the 
  ///  attention of the user or to improve performance.
  ///
  ///  The enabled field enables and disables the VisibilitySensor node.
  ///  If enabled is set to FALSE, the VisibilitySensor node does not 
  ///  send events. If enabled is TRUE, the VisibilitySensor node detects
  ///  changes to the visibility status of the box specified and sends 
  ///  events through the isActive field. A TRUE event is output to isActive
  ///  when any portion of the box impacts the rendered view. A FALSE event
  ///  is sent when the box has no effect on the view. Browsers shall 
  ///  guarantee that, if isActive is FALSE, the box has absolutely no 
  ///  effect on the rendered view. Browsers may err liberally when isActive
  ///  is TRUE. For example, the box may affect the rendering.
  ///
  ///  The fields center and size specify the object space location of the
  ///  box centre and the extents of the box (i.e., width, height, and depth).
  ///  The VisibilitySensor node's box is affected by hierarchical 
  ///  transformations of its parents. The components of the size field
  ///  shall be greater than or equal to zero.
  ///
  ///  The enterTime event is generated whenever the isActive TRUE event
  ///  is generated, and exitTime events are generated whenever isActive
  ///  FALSE events are generated. A VisibilitySensor read from an X3D 
  ///  file shall generate isActive TRUE and enterTime events if the sensor
  ///  is enabled and the visibility box is visible. A VisibilitySensor 
  ///  inserted into the transformation hierarchy shall generate isActive
  ///  TRUE and enterTime events if the sensor is enabled and the visibility
  ///  box is visible. A VisibilitySensor removed from the transformation 
  ///  hierarchy shall generate isActive FALSE and exitTime events if the
  ///  sensor is enabled and the visibility box is visible.
  ///
  ///  Each VisibilitySensor node behaves independently of all other 
  ///  VisibilitySensor nodes. Every enabled VisibilitySensor node 
  ///  that is affected by the user's movement receives and sends events,
  ///  possibly resulting in multiple VisibilitySensor nodes receiving 
  ///  and sending events simultaneously. Unlike TouchSensor nodes, there
  ///  is no notion of a VisibilitySensor node lower in the scene graph 
  ///  "grabbing" events. Multiply instanced VisibilitySensor nodes 
  ///  (i.e., DEF/USE) use the union of all the boxes defined by their 
  ///  instances. An instanced VisibilitySensor node shall detect visibility
  ///  changes for all instances of the box and send events appropriately.
  ///
