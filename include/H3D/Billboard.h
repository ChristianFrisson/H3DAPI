  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class Billboard
  /// \brief The Billboard node is a grouping node
  /// which modifies its coordinate system so that the Billboard
  /// node's local Z-axis turns to point at the viewer. The Billboard
  /// node has children which may be other children nodes.
  ///
  /// The axisOfRotation field specifies which axis to use to perform the
  /// rotation. This axis is defined in the local coordinate system. When
  /// the axisOfRotation field is not (0, 0, 0), the following steps
  /// describe how to rotate the billboard to face the viewer:
  ///
  /// <ol>
  /// <li> Compute the vector from the Billboard node's origin to the viewer's
  ///    position. This vector is called the billboard-to-viewer vector.
  ///
  /// <li> Compute the plane defined by the axisOfRotation and the
  ///    billboard-to-viewer vector.
  ///
  /// <li> Rotate the local Z-axis of the billboard into the plane from b.,
  ///   pivoting around the axisOfRotation.
  /// </ol>
  /// When the axisOfRotation field is set to (0, 0, 0), the special case of
  /// viewer-alignment is indicated. In this case, the object rotates to
  /// keep the billboard's local Y-axis parallel with the Y-axis of the
  /// viewer. This special case is distinguished by setting the
  /// axisOfRotation to (0, 0, 0). The following steps describe how to align
  /// the billboard's Y-axis to the Y-axis of the viewer:
  ///
  /// <ol>
  /// <li> Compute the billboard-to-viewer vector.
  ///
  /// <li> Rotate the Z-axis of the billboard to be collinear with the
  ///    billboard-to-viewer vector and pointing towards the viewer's 
  ///    position. 
  ///
  /// <li> Rotate the Y-axis of the billboard to be parallel and oriented in 
  ///    the same direction as the Y-axis of the viewer.
  /// </ol>
  /// If the axisOfRotation and the billboard-to-viewer line are coincident,
  /// the plane cannot be established and the resulting rotation of the
  /// billboard is undefined. For example, if the axisOfRotation is set to
  /// (0,1,0) (Y-axis) and the viewer flies over the billboard and peers
  /// directly down the Y-axis, the results are undefined.
  ///
  /// Multiple instances of Billboard nodes (DEF/USE) operate as expected:
  /// each instance rotates in its unique coordinate system to face the
  /// viewer.
  ///
  /// The bboxCenter and bboxSize fields specify a bounding box that
  /// encloses the Billboard node's children. This is a hint that may be
  /// used for optimization purposes. The results are undefined if the
  /// specified bounding box is smaller than the actual bounding box of the
  /// children at any time. A default bboxSize value, (-1, -1, -1), implies
  /// that the bounding box is not specified and if needed shall be
  /// calculated by the browser.
