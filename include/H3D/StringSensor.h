  /// \brief A StringSensor node generates events as the user presses
  ///  keys on the keyboard. A StringSensor node can be enabled or 
  ///  disabled by sending it an enabled event with a value of TRUE 
  ///  or FALSE. If the StringSensor node is disabled, it does not 
  ///  track keyboard input or send events.
  ///
  ///  enteredText events are generated as keys which produce characters
  ///  are pressed on the keyboard. The value of this event is the UTF-8
  ///  string entered including the latest character struck. The set of 
  ///  UTF-8 characters that can be generated will vary between different
  ///  keyboards and different implementations. 
  /// 
  ///  If a deletionAllowed has value TRUE, the previously entered character
  ///  in the enteredText is removed when the backspace key is entered.
  ///  If deletionAllowed has value FALSE, characters 
  ///  may only be added to the string; deletion of characters shall not 
  ///  be allowed. Should the browser-recognized value for deleting the 
  ///  preceding character is entered, it shall be ignored.
  ///
  ///  The finalText event is generated whenever the browser-recognized
  ///  value for terminating a string is entered; in H3D this is the enter key.
  ///  When this recognition occurs, the finalText field generates an event 
  ///  with value equal to that of enteredText. After the finalText field 
  ///  event has been generated, the enteredText field is set to the empty
  ///  string but no event is generated.
  ///
  ///  When the user begins typing, the StringSensor sends an isActive
  ///  event with value TRUE. When the string is terminated, the StringSensor
  ///  sends an isActive event with value FALSE.
  ///
  ///  The StringSensor is not affected by its position in the
  ///  transformation hierarchy.
  ///
