  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class Collision
  /// \brief The Collision node is a grouping node that specifies the collision
  /// detection properties for its children (and their descendants), specifies
  /// surrogate objects that replace its children during collision detection,
  /// and sends events signalling that a collision has occurred between the
  /// avatar and the Collision node's geometry or surrogate. By default, all
  /// geometric nodes in the scene are collidable with the viewer except
  /// IndexedLineSet and PointSet. Browsers shall detect geometric collisions
  /// between the avatar (see NavigationInfo) and the scene's geometry
  /// and prevent the avatar from 'entering' the geometry. See 23.2.4 Collision
  /// detection and terrain following for general information on collision
  /// detection.
  ///
  /// If there are no Collision nodes specified in a X3D file, browsers shall
  /// detect collisions between the avatar and all objects during navigation.
  /// 
  /// The Collision node's enabled field enables and disables collision
  /// detection as well as terrain following when the navigation type requires
  /// it. If enabled is set to FALSE, the children and all descendants of the
  /// Collision node shall not be checked for collision or terrain, even though
  /// they are drawn. This includes any descendent Collision nodes that have
  /// enabled set to TRUE (i.e., setting enabled to FALSE turns collision off
  /// for every child node below it).
  ///
  /// The value of the isActive field indicates the current state of the
  /// Collision node. An isActive TRUE event is generated when a collision
  /// occurs. An isActive FALSE event is generated when a collision no longer
  /// occurs.
  ///
  /// Collision nodes with the enabled field set to TRUE detect the nearest
  /// collision with their descendent geometry (or proxies). When the nearest
  /// collision is detected, the collided Collision node sends the time of the
  /// collision through its collideTime field. If a Collision node contains a
  /// child, descendant, or proxy (see below) that is a Collision node, and
  /// both Collision nodes detect that a collision has occurred, both send a
  /// collideTime event at the same time. A collideTime event shall be
  /// generated if the avatar is colliding with collidable geometry when the
  /// Collision node is read from a X3D file or inserted into the
  /// transformation hierarchy.
  ///
  /// The bboxCenter and bboxSize fields specify a bounding box that encloses
  /// the Collision node's children. This is a hint that may be used for
  /// optimization purposes. The results are undefined if the specified
  /// bounding box is smaller than the actual bounding box of the children at
  /// any time. A default bboxSize value, (-1, -1, -1), implies that the
  /// bounding box is not specified and if needed shall be calculated by the
  /// browser. More details on the bboxCenter and bboxSize fields can be found
  /// in 10.2.2 Bounding boxes..
  ///
  /// The collision proxy, defined in the proxy field, is any legal children
  /// node as described in 10.2.1 Grouping and children node types that is used
  /// as a substitute for the Collision node's children during collision
  /// detection. The proxy is used strictly for collision detection; it is not
  /// drawn.
  ///
  /// If the value of the enabled field is TRUE and the proxy field is
  /// non-NULL, the proxy field defines the scene on which collision detection
  /// is performed. If the proxy value is NULL, collision detection is
  /// performed against the children of the Collision node.
  /// If proxy is specified, any descendent children of the Collision node are
  /// ignored during collision detection. If children is empty, enabled is
  /// TRUE, and proxy is specified, collision detection is performed against
  /// the proxy but nothing is displayed. In this manner, invisible collision
  /// objects may be supported.
  ///
  /// The collideTime field generates an event specifying the time when the
  /// avatar (see 23.3.4 NavigationInfo) makes contact with the collidable
  /// children or proxy of the Collision node. An ideal implementation computes
  /// the exact time of collision. Implementations may approximate the ideal by
  /// sampling the positions of collidable objects and the user.
  /// The NavigationInfo node contains additional information for parameters
  /// that control the avatar size.
  /// <b>Examples:</b>
  ///   - <a href="../../../H3DAPI/examples/All/Collision.x3d">Collision.x3d</a>
  ///     ( <a href="examples/Collision.x3d.html">Source</a> )
  // According to X3D-spec Collision should inherit from X3DSensorNode
  // but since this is not allowed (for the database and such) the fields
  // in common with X3DSensorNode (enabled and isActive)
  // will just be defined here instead.
