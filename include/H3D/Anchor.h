  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class Anchor
  /// \brief The Anchor grouping node retrieves the content of a URL when the
  /// user activates (e.g., clicks) some geometry contained within the Anchor
  /// node's children. If the URL points to a valid X3D file, that world
  /// replaces the world of which the Anchor node is a part (except when the
  /// parameter field, described below, alters this behaviour). If non-X3D data
  /// is retrieved, the browser shall determine how to handle that data;
  /// typically, it will be passed to an appropriate non-X3D browser.
  ///
  /// Exactly how a user activates geometry contained by the Anchor node
  /// depends on the pointing device and is determined by the X3D browser.
  /// Typically, clicking with the pointing device will result in the new scene
  /// replacing the current scene. An Anchor node with an empty url does
  /// nothing when its children are chosen. For a description of how multiple
  /// Anchors and pointing-device sensors are resolved on activation see the
  /// Pointing Device Sensor Component in the X3D specification.
  ///
  /// The description field in the Anchor node specifies a textual description
  /// of the Anchor node. This may be used by browser-specific user interfaces
  /// that wish to present users with more detailed information about the
  /// Anchor.
  ///
  /// The parameter  field may be used to supply any additional information to
  /// be interpreted by the browser. Each string shall consist of
  /// "keyword=value" pairs. For example, some browsers allow the specification
  /// of a "target" for a link to display a link in another part of an HTML
  /// document. The parameter field is then:
  ///
  /// Anchor { \n
  ///  parameter [ "target=name_of_frame" ]; \n
  ///  ... \n
  /// }\n
  ///
  /// An Anchor node may be used to bind the initial Viewpoint node in a world
  /// by specifying a URL ending with "#ViewpointName" where "ViewpointName" is
  /// the DEF name of a viewpoint defined in the X3D file.
  ///
  /// EXAMPLE \n
  ///
  /// Anchor { \n
  ///   url "http://www.school.edu/X3D/someScene.wrl#OverView";\n
  ///     children  Shape { geometry Box {} };\n
  /// }\n
  ///
  /// specifies an anchor that loads the X3D file "someScene.wrl" and binds the
  /// initial user view to the Viewpoint node named "OverView" when the Anchor
  /// node's geometry (Box) is activated. If the named Viewpoint node is not
  /// found in the X3D file, the X3D file is loaded using the default Viewpoint
  /// node binding stack rules.
  ///
  /// If the url field is specified in the form "#ViewpointName"
  /// (i.e., no file name), the Viewpoint node with the given name
  /// ("ViewpointName") in the Anchor's run-time name scope(s) shall be bound
  /// (set_bind TRUE). The results are undefined if there are multiple
  /// Viewpoints with the same name in the Anchor's run-time name scope(s).
  /// The results are undefined if the Anchor node is not part of any run-time
  /// name scope or is part of more than one run-time name scope.
  /// ( RUN-TIME scope not implemented, if the name exist the first created
  /// X3DViewpoint with the correct name will be used )
  ///  
  /// For example:
  ///
  /// Anchor { \n
  ///   url "#Doorway"; \n
  ///   children Shape { geometry Sphere {} }; \n
  /// } \n
  ///
  /// binds the viewer to the viewpoint defined by the "Doorway" viewpoint in
  /// the current world when the sphere is activated. In this case, if the
  /// Viewpoint is not found, no action occurs on activation.
  /// NOTE: This node is not fully tested and may crash now and then when used.
