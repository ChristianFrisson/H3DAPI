  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class Background
  /// \brief A background node that uses six static images to compose the 
  /// backdrop.
  ///
  /// The backUrl, bottomUrl, frontUrl, leftUrl, rightUrl, and topUrl fields
  /// specify the url to a set of images that define a background panorama
  /// between the ground/sky backdrop and the scene's geometry. The panorama
  /// consists of six images, each of which is mapped onto a face of an 
  /// infinitely large cube contained within the backdrop spheres and centred
  /// in the local coordinate system. The images are applied individually
  /// to each face of the cube. On the front, back, right, and left faces 
  /// of the cube, when viewed from the origin looking down the negative
  /// Z-axis with the Y-axis as the view up direction, each image is mapped
  /// onto the corresponding face with the same orientation as if the image
  /// were displayed normally in 2D (back to back face, front to front face,
  /// left to left face, and right to right face). On the top face of the
  /// cube, when viewed from the origin looking along the +Y-axis with the 
  /// +Z-axis as the view up direction, the top image is mapped onto the face
  /// with the same orientation as if the image were displayed normally in 
  /// 2D. On the bottom face of the box, when viewed from the origin along
  /// the negative Y-axis with the negative Z-axis as the view up direction,
  /// the bottom image is mapped onto the face with the same orientation as
  ///if the image were displayed normally in 2D.
  ///
  /// Alpha values in the panorama images (i.e., two or four component images)
  /// specify that the panorama is semi-transparent or transparent in regions,
  /// allowing the groundColor and skyColor to be visible.
  ///
  /// Often, the bottom and top images will not be specified, to allow sky
  /// and ground to show. The other four images may depict surrounding
  /// mountains or other distant scenery. 
  /// 
  /// The other fields work just as in X3DBackgroundNode.
  ///
