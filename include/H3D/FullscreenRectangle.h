  /// \brief The FullscreenRectangle node draws a rectangle covering
  /// the entire screen. 
  /// This can be useful e.g. to draw the output from the 
  /// FrameBufferTextureGenerator node.
  ///
  /// The zValue field specifies where in depth the rectangle will be drawn.
  /// This controls of it draws over what is already in the frame buffer or not.
  /// The value is between -1 and 1 where -1 means drawing at near plane and 1 
  /// at far plane.
  ///
  /// The screenAligned field determines if the rectangle should always been 
  /// drawn in relation to the screen(i.e. upperleft corner of rectangle is
  /// always mapped to upper left corner of the screen) or if it should be affected
  /// by transforms that flip coordinate axis such as using mirrored mode.
  /// Usually one sets screenAligned to true if using the FullscreenRectangle
  /// to show a generated frame buffer from e.g. FrameBufferTextureGenerator
  /// and false for other content that should be mirrored in mirrored mode.
  ///
