  /// \ingroup AbstractNodes
  /// \class ProximitySensor
  /// \brief The ProximitySensor node generates events when the viewer enters,
  /// exits, and moves within a region in space (defined by a box). A 
  /// proximity sensor is enabled or disabled by sending it an enabled event
  /// with a value of TRUE or FALSE. A disabled sensor does not send events.
  /// A ProximitySensor node generates isActive TRUE/FALSE events as the viewer
  /// enters and exits the rectangular box defined by its center and size 
  /// fields. Browsers shall interpolate viewer positions and timestamp the
  /// isActive events with the exact time the viewer first intersected the
  /// proximity region. The center field defines the centre point of the 
  /// proximity region in object space. The size field specifies a vector 
  /// which defines the width (x), height (y), and depth (z) of the box
  /// bounding the region. The components of the size field shall be greater
  /// than or equal to zero. ProximitySensor nodes are affected by the 
  /// hierarchical transformations of their parents.
  ///
  /// The enterTime event is generated whenever the isActive TRUE event is
  /// generated (user enters the box), and exitTime events are generated
  /// whenever an isActive FALSE event is generated (user exits the box).
  ///
  /// The centerOfRotation_changed field sends events whenever the user is
  /// contained within the proximity region and the center of rotation of the
  /// viewer for EXAMINE mode changes with respect to the ProximitySensor 
  /// node's coordinate system. This may result when the bound Viewpoint 
  /// nodes's center of rotation changes, when a new viewpoint is bound, when
  /// the user changes the center of rotation through the browser's user 
  /// interface, or from changes to the ProximitySensor node's coordinate 
  /// system. centerOfRotation_changed events are only generated when the 
  /// currently bound NavigationInfo node includes LOOKAT navigation. 
  ///
  /// The position_changed and orientation_changed fields send events whenever
  /// the user is contained within the proximity region and the position and
  /// orientation of the viewer changes with respect to the ProximitySensor
  /// node's coordinate system including enter and exit times. The viewer
  /// movement may be a result of a variety of circumstances resulting from
  /// browser navigation, ProximitySensor node's coordinate system changes, or
  /// bound Viewpoint node's position or orientation changes.
  ///
  /// Each ProximitySensor node behaves independently of all other 
  /// ProximitySensor nodes. Every enabled ProximitySensor node that is
  /// affected by the viewer's movement receives and sends events, possibly 
  /// resulting in multiple ProximitySensor nodes receiving and sending events
  /// simultaneously. Unlike TouchSensor nodes, there is no notion of a
  /// ProximitySensor node lower in the scene graph "grabbing" events.
  /// Instanced (DEF/USE) ProximitySensor nodes use the union of all the boxes
  /// to check for enter and exit. A multiply instanced ProximitySensor node 
  /// will detect enter and exit for all instances of the box and send 
  /// enter/exit events appropriately. For non-overlapping bounding boxes, 
  /// position_changed and orientation_changed events are calculated relative
  /// to the coordinate system associated with the bounding box in which the
  /// proximity was detected. However, the results are undefined if the any of
  /// the boxes of a multiply instanced ProximitySensor node overlap.
  ///
  /// A ProximitySensor node that surrounds the entire world has an enterTime 
  /// equal to the time that the world was entered and can be used to start up
  /// animations or behaviours as soon as a world is loaded. A ProximitySensor 
  /// node with a box containing zero volume (i.e., any size field element of 
  /// 0.0) cannot generate events. This is equivalent to setting the enabled 
  /// field to FALSE.
  ///
  /// A ProximitySensor read from an X3D file shall generate isActive TRUE,
  /// position_changed, orientation_changed and enterTime events if the sensor
  /// is enabled and the viewer is inside the proximity region. A 
  /// ProximitySensor inserted into the transformation hierarchy shall 
  /// generate isActive TRUE, position_changed, orientation_changed and 
  /// enterTime events if the sensor is enabled and the viewer is inside
  /// the proximity region. A ProximitySensor removed from the transformation
  /// hierarchy shall generate isActive FALSE, position_changed, 
  /// orientation_changed and exitTime events if the sensor is enabled and the
  /// viewer is inside the proximity region.
