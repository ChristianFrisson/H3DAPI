  /// \class LocalFog
  /// \brief The LocalFog node provides a way to simulate atmospheric effects
  /// by blending objects with the colour specified by the color field based
  /// on the distances of the various objects from the viewer. 
  /// The distances are calculated in the coordinate space of the LocalFog
  /// node. The visibilityRange field specifies the distance in metres (in
  /// the local coordinate system) at which objects are totally obscured by 
  /// the fog. Objects located outside the visibilityRange from the viewer are
  /// drawn with a constant colour of color. Objects very close to the viewer
  /// are blended very little with the fog color. A visibilityRange of 0.0 
  /// disables the LocalFog node. The visibilityRange is affected by the
  /// scaling transformations of the LocalFog node’s parents; translations
  /// and rotations have no affect on visibilityRange.
  ///
  /// The fogType field controls how much of the fog colour is blended with
  /// the object as a function of distance. If fogType is "LINEAR", the amount
  /// of blending is a linear function of the distance, resulting in a depth
  /// cueing effect. If fogType is "EXPONENTIAL", an exponential increase in
  /// blending is used, resulting in a more natural fog appearance.
  ///
  /// <b>Examples:</b>
  ///   - <a href="../../../H3DAPI/examples/All/LocalFog.x3d">LocalFog.x3d</a>
