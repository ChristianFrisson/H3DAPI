  /// \class WindPhysicsModel
  /// \brief The WindPhysicsModel node specifies a physics model that 
  /// applies a wind effect to the particles. The wind has a random
  /// variation factor that allows for the gustiness of the wind to be
  /// modelled.
  ///
  /// The direction field specifies the direction in which the wind is
  /// travelling in the form of a  normalized, unit vector. 
  ///
  /// The speed field specifies the current wind speed in metres per second.
  /// From the wind speed, the force applied per unit-area on the particle
  /// is calculated using the following formula:
  ///
  /// pressure = 10(2 × log(speed)) × 0.64615
  /// 
  /// The gustiness specifies how much the wind speed varies from the average
  /// value defined by the speed field. The wind speed variation is calculated
  /// once per frame and applied equally to all particles.
  ///
  /// The turbulence field specifies how much the wind acts directly in line
  /// with the direction, and how much variation is applied in directions
  /// other than the wind direction. This is determined per-particle to
  /// model how the particle is effected by turbulence.
  ///
