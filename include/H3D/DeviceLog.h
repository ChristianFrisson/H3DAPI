  /// \brief DeviceLog records haptic device data to a
  /// binary data file. It is essentially a ForceEffect that always calculates
  /// a zero force and logs data for the haptics device.
  ///
  /// Warning. If any of the fields of this node changes ( with the exception
  /// of metadata ) a new log will be created and possibly old data in the
  /// file(s) pointed to in the url field will be overwritten. 
  ///
  /// For information on how to read the log created by this node see comments
  /// for the logBinary field.
  ///
  /// <b>Examples:</b>
  ///   - <a href="../../../H3DAPI/examples/All/DeviceLog.x3d">DeviceLog.x3d</a>
  ///     ( <a href="examples/DeviceLog.x3d.html">Source</a> )

    /// strings which are valid for the logData field. The ALL string will
    /// never show up.
    /// When logging to a binary file the file format will be the following.
    /// The first bytes should be read as characters into a string. When two
    /// consecutive '\\0'-characters are found the section with different
    /// strings are over. These strings correspond to the first line in a text
    /// file.
    /// When the first strings are read the data that follows will be in the
    /// order listed by the strings. In an ascii-file each line will contain
    /// one log entry for each of the strings, each number is separated by
    /// space. In the binary file the numbers will follow eachother without any
    /// separating bytes.
    /// The encoding will be as follows:
