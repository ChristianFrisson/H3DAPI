H3D API is a cross-platform, device independent haptics and graphics scenegraph
API. It can be used to develop applications using haptics and graphics from
scratch. For information on how you are allowed to use H3D API see the LICENSE
file in the same folder as this file.

This file contains complete installation instructions for Linux, Mac and Windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on Linux:
Currently you need to build H3D API on Linux yourself. Since you have this file
you have already obtained and unpacked the source for H3D API. To build H3D API
on Linux follow these steps.

1. Install version 2.4.7 or later of CMake. To do this on Ubuntu open a
   terminal and write:
    sudo apt-get install cmake

2. Download the source for HAPI. Build and install HAPI on your system. H3D API
   requires HAPI.

3. H3D API depends on other libraries. These need to be installed if the feature
   is required. The build system used by H3D API will detect which libraries
   are installed on the system and only enable the features that the system can
   support. The libraries used by H3D API are:

   Required libraries. Without this H3D API will not function.
    - glew, extended OpenGL functions
    - opengl.

   Optional libraries, without these some features of H3D API will be disabled
   and some of the distributed examples will not work.
    - Xerces, for parsing X3D-files.
    - ftgl, for rendering fonts in OpenGL.
    - openAL, for sound in H3D API.
    - alut, for sound in H3D API.
    - glut, used as the window system.
    - freeglut, extended functions of the windows system.
    - curl, used for handling urls.
    - audiofile, for reading sound files.
    - fontconfig, for fonts in H3D API.
    - vorbis, to read more sound files.
    - python, for python scripting support.
    - WxWidgets. Needed for H3DViewer. 
    - FreeImage. Used to read images.

   If using Ubuntu, several of these libraries can be obtained by using the
   apt-get feature. In a terminal write:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libxerces27 libxerces27-dev ftgl-dev \
    libopenal0a libalut0 libalut-dev libopenal-dev libglew-dev libglut \
    libglut3-dev libcurl3-dev libaudiofile-dev libfontconfig1-dev \
    libfontconfig1 libvorbis-dev python-dev python-all-dev libfreeimage-dev \
    alien

   The first two are the C++ compilers needed to compile H3D API.

   Freeglut can be obtained using the following commands:
    wget http://ovh.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/freeglut/freeglut-2.4.0.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf freeglut-2.4.0.tar.gz
    cd freeglut-2.4.0
    ./configure CFLAGS="-fexceptions" CXXFLAGS="-fexceptions"
    make
    sudo make install

   To install WxWidgets (version 2.8) write:
     sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev

4. In the terminal change folder to the H3DAPI/build folder. Write:
    cmake .
   This will generate a make file. To use the makefile write:
    make

   H3D API will be built. When the make finished write:
    sudo make install

   H3D API libraries are now installed on your system. But there is no
   application installed that use H3D API libraries.

5. There are two applications provided that can be used to load the example
   x3d-files provided. These applications are H3DLoad and H3DViewer. To build
   and install these programs do the following.
    Change folder to H3DAPI/H3DLoad/build.
    cmake .
    sudo make install
   
    Change folder to H3DAPI/H3DViewer/build
    cmake .
    sudo make install.

   If only one of these applications is desired then only build and install one
   of them.

5. To use the SettingGUI.py program located in the H3DAPI/settings folder the
   H3D_ROOT environment variable needs to be set to the folder H3DAPI.
   When this is done the program can be started by navigating to the appropiate
   folder and writing "python SettingsGUI.py" in the terminal. Without this
   program H3DLoad and H3DViewer will not be configured correctly for the 
   examples provided.

6. Test your installation by changing directory to
   H3DAPI/example/x3dmodels/berk and write:
     H3DLoad berk.x3d

Installation on Windows:
To install H3D API on Windows follow these steps:
1. Download Windows installation file from www.h3d.org.
2. Install H3D API using this file.
3. Run examples through start menu.

For information on how to build H3D API on Windows see the pdf-manual
and/or the wiki.

Installation on Mac:
 - To be written.
