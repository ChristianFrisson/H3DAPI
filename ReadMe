H3DAPI is a cross-platform, device independent haptics and graphics scenegraph
API. It can be used to develop applications using haptics and graphics from
scratch. For information on how you are allowed to use H3DAPI see the LICENSE
file in the same folder as this file.

This file contains complete installation instructions for Linux, Mac and Windows.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
External Libraries:
H3DAPI depends on other libraries. Some of them are required for H3DAPI to
compile others are optional. The build system used by H3DAPI will detect which
libraries are installed on the system and only enable the features that the
system can support. For Windows most libraries are included. Those missing must
be downloaded, compiled and installed on the system used if that feature is
desired. Note that all libraries that are required or optional in HAPI also
are required and optional by H3DAPI. The libraries used by H3DAPI are:
 
 Required libraries. Without these H3DAPI will not function.
  - GLEW, extended OpenGL functions. http://glew.sourceforge.net/
  - OpenGL. Installed on all systems. For those interested see http://www.opengl.org/
  - pthread. Included with Windows distribution, most probably installed on
    other systems.
  - GLUT or Freeglut. Freeglut is a better choice. http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/
    Must be compiled with -fexceptions as a compiler flag to allow c++ exceptions.
 
 Optional libraries, without these some features of H3DAPI will be disabled
 and some of the distributed examples will not work.

Installation on Linux:
Using debian packages:
1. Modify sources.list ( or whatever file is used to specify urls to debian
   packages ) by adding ftp://www.h3dapi.org/pub/releases/linux/debian/
   to it.
   On Ubuntu 12.04 simply use:
     sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
     Then add 
       deb ftp://www.h3dapi.org/pub/releases/linux/debian precise sensegraphics
       deb-src ftp://www.h3dapi.org/pub/releases/linux/debian precise sensegraphics
     
     If you use a different linux version simply switch "precise" for the name
     of your distribution.
     
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get install libh3dapi2
4. sudo apt-get install h3dviewer. This step is optional.
5. Use H3DViewer to open any x3d file.
     
Building from source:
Since you have this file
you have already obtained and unpacked the source for H3DAPI. To build H3DAPI
on Linux follow these steps.

1. Install version 2.8.0 or later of CMake. To do this on Ubuntu open a
   terminal and write:
    sudo apt-get install cmake

2. Download the source for HAPI. Build and install HAPI on your system. H3DAPI
   requires HAPI.

3. H3DAPI depends on other libraries. The build system used by H3DAPI will 
   detect which libraries are installed on the system and only enable the
   features that the system can support. If more features are desired the
   corresponding library has to be installed. Note that some libraries are
   required for H3DAPI to compile. See the list of external libraries in the
   beginning of this ReadMe.
   
   For linux the library fontconfig1 is also needed. www.fontconfig.org

   If using Ubuntu, several of these libraries can be obtained by using the
   apt-get feature. Note that for later versions of Ubuntu than
   7.10 the required and/or optional libraries might be of newer versions that
   those given here. The newer versions shold work with H3DAPI but it might not
   be guaranteed. In a terminal write:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ libxerces27 libxerces27-dev ftgl-dev \
    libopenal0a libalut0 libalut-dev libopenal-dev libglew-dev libglut \
    libglut3-dev libcurl3-dev libaudiofile-dev libfontconfig1-dev \
    libfontconfig1 libvorbis-dev python-dev python-all-dev libfreeimage-dev \
    alien

   The first two are the C++ compilers needed to compile H3DAPI.

   To install WxWidgets (version 2.8) write:
    sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.8-dev
   
   In version 8.04 of Ubuntu another library might need to be installed:
     sudo apt-get install libxi-dev libxmu-dev   

4. In the terminal change folder to the H3DAPI/build folder. Write:
    cmake .
   This will generate a make file. To use the makefile write:
    make

   H3DAPI will be built. When the make finished write:
    sudo make install

   H3DAPI libraries are now installed on your system. But there is no
   application installed that use H3DAPI libraries.

5. There are two applications provided that can be used to load the example
   x3d-files provided. These applications are H3DLoad and H3DViewer. To build
   and install these programs do the following.
    Change folder to H3DAPI/H3DLoad/build.
    cmake .
    sudo make install
   
    Change folder to H3DAPI/H3DViewer/build
    cmake .
    sudo make install.

   If only one of these applications is desired then only build and install one
   of them.

5. To use the SettingGUI.py program located in the H3DAPI/settings folder the
   H3D_ROOT environment variable needs to be set to the folder H3DAPI.
   When this is done the program can be started by navigating to the appropiate
   folder and writing "python SettingsGUI.py" in the terminal. Without this
   program H3DLoad and H3DViewer will not be configured correctly for the 
   examples provided.

6. Test your installation by changing directory to
   H3DAPI/example/x3dmodels/berk and write:
     H3DLoad berk.x3d

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on Windows:
To install H3DAPI on Windows follow these steps:
1. Go to www.h3d.org.
2. Download latest release of H3DViewer
3. Install H3DViewer.
4. Open any x3d file.

Build from source:
1. Go to www.h3d.org.
2. Download latest release of H3DAPI.
3. In the installer, on the page where you choose what to install make sure
   H3DAPI is seleted. Then continue installing.
4. Use CMake to generate project files for your compiler. Tested with visual
   studio 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2012.
5. Open the solution file and build the INSTALL target.
6. If H3DViewer/H3DLoad is desired check H3DAPI_LOADER_PROJECTS in the cmake
   configuration step. Use these programs to open an x3d file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on MacOS X:
Currently you need to build H3DAPI on MacOS X yourself. Since you have this
file you have already obtained and unpacked the source for H3DAPI. To build
H3DAPI on MacOS X follow these steps.
1. Install version 2.8.0 or later of CMake.
2. Install XCode. If gcc is an unrecognized command in the terminal after
   installing XCode there is a high probability that CMake will not be able to
   generate build files for gcc and/or XCode. Another version of XCode could be
   used or fix it in some other way.
3. Download the source for HAPI. Build and install HAPI on your system. H3DAPI
   requires HAPI.
4. H3DAPI depends on other libraries. The build system used by H3DAPI will 
   detect which libraries are installed on the system and only enable the
   features that the system can support. If more features are desired the
   corresponding library has to be installed. Note that some libraries are
   required for H3DAPI to compile. See the list of external libraries in the
   beginning of this ReadMe.
5. Generate build files for your build system using CMake. Either use the
   console version as in the guide for linux above or use the GUI version in
   which the first textbox should contain the location of the CMakeLists.txt
   file. This can be located in H3DAPI/build. The second box is the location
   of where the build files will be created. Use for example H3DAPI/build/OSX.
   Press configure, choose which system to generate build files for wait and
   press configure again until the generate button can be used. Press generate
   and then the build files will be in the choosen folder. If "Unix Makefile"
   are choosen then proceed from point 4 in the linux above.
6. Generate build files for H3DLoad and H3DViewer with the CMakeLists.txt
   located in H3DAPI/H3DLoad/build and H3DAPI/H3DViewer/build. Build these
   and test your installation by starting H3DViewer and opening a file using
   the menu. Alternatively you could open a file with H3DLoad from the terminal
   as in step 6 of the linux guide.
