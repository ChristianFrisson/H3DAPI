  /// \brief This is the base node type for all composed 3D geometry in X3D. 
  ///
  /// A composed geometry node type defines an abstract type that composes
  /// geometry from a set of nodes that define individual
  /// components. Composed geometry may have color, coordinates, normal and
  /// texture coordinates supplied. The rendered output of the combination
  /// of these is dependent on the concrete node definition. However, in
  /// general, the following rules shall be applied for all nodes:
  ///
  /// - If the color field is not NULL, it shall contain an X3DColorNode node
  ///   whose colours are applied to the vertices or faces of the
  ///   X3DComposedGeometryNode as follows: 
  ///
  /// - If colorPerVertex is FALSE, colours are applied to each face. If
  ///   colorPerVertex is true, colours are applied to each vertex. 
  ///
  /// - If the color field is NULL, the geometry shall be rendered normally
  ///   using the Material and texture defined in the Appearance node (see
  ///   12.2.2 Appearance node for details). 
  ///
  /// - If normalPerVertex is FALSE, colours are applied to each face. If
  ///   normalPerVertex is true, colours are applied to each vertex. 
  ///
  /// - If the normal field is not NULL, it shall contain a Normal node whose
  ///   normals are applied to the vertices or faces of the
  ///   X3DComposedGeometryNode in a manner exactly equivalent to that
  ///   described above for applying colours to vertices/faces (where
  ///   normalPerVertex corresponds to colorPerVertex and normalIndex
  ///   corresponds to colorIndex). 
  ///
  /// - If the normal field is NULL, the browser shall automatically generate
  ///   normals in accordance with the node's definition. If the node does not
  ///   define a behaviour, the default is to generate an averaged normal for
  ///   all faces that share that vertex. 
  ///
  /// If the texCoord field is not NULL, it shall contain a
  /// TextureCoordinate node.
  ///
  /// If the attrib field is not empty it shall contain a list of
  /// X3DVertexAttributeNode instances with per-vertex attribute
  /// information for programmable shaders.
  ///
