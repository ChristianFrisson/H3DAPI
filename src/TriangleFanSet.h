  /// \brief A TriangleFanSet represents a 3D shape composed of triangles that
  /// form a fan shape around the first vertex declared in each fan. 
  ///
  /// The fanCount field describes how many vertices are to be used in each
  /// fan from the coordinate field. Coordinates are assigned to each fan
  /// by taking fanCount[n] vertices from the coordinate field. Each value
  /// of the fanCount array shall be greater than or equal to three. It
  /// shall be an error to have a value less than three. 
  ///
  /// The TriangleFanSet node is specified in the local coordinate system
  /// and is affected by the transformations of its ancestors. 
  /// If values are provided for the color, normal, and
  /// texCoord fields, there shall be at least as many values as are present
  /// in the coord field. The value of the colorPerVertex field is ignored
  /// and always treated as TRUE. If the normal field is not provided, for
  /// each fan, the normal shall be generated as follows: 
  ///
  /// - if normalPerVertex is TRUE, the normal shall be the average of all
  /// triangles within that fan sharing that vertex. For the vertex of the
  /// fan, the normal shall be the average of the contributions of all of 
  /// the individual face normals. 
  /// - If normalPerVertex is FALSE, the normal shall be generated
  /// for the current triangle based on the ccw field.
