  /// \class TimeSensor
  /// \brief TimeSensor nodes generate events as time passes. 
  ///
  /// TimeSensor nodes can be used for many purposes including: 
  ///
  ///  - driving continuous simulations and animations; 
  ///  - controlling periodic activities (e.g., one per minute); 
  ///  - initiating single occurrence events such as an alarm clock. 
  ///
  /// The TimeSensor node contains two discrete outputOnly fields: 
  /// isActive and cycleTime. The isActive outputOnly field sends TRUE when
  /// the TimeSensor node begins running, and FALSE when it stops running. 
  /// The cycleTime outputOnly field sends a time event at startTime and at 
  /// the beginning of each new cycle (useful for synchronization with other 
  /// time-based objects). The remaining outputOnly fields generate continuous
  /// events. The fraction_changed outputOnly field, an SFFloat in the closed
  /// interval [0,1], sends the completed fraction of the current cycle.
  /// The time outputOnly field sends the absolute time for a given 
  /// simulation tick.
  ///
  /// If the enabled field is TRUE, the TimeSensor node is enabled and may
  /// be running. If a set_enabled FALSE event is received while the 
  /// TimeSensor node is running, the sensor performs the following actions:
  /// - evaluates and sends all relevant outputs;
  /// - sends a FALSE value for isActive;
  /// - disables itself.
  /// 
  /// Input events on the fields of the TimeSensor node (e.g., set_startTime)
  /// are processed and their corresponding outputOnly fields 
  /// (e.g., startTime_changed) are sent regardless of the state of the
  /// enabled field. The remaining discussion assumes enabled is TRUE.
  ///
  /// The "cycle" of a TimeSensor node lasts for cycleInterval seconds. 
  /// The value of cycleInterval shall be greater than zero.
  ///
  /// A cycleTime outputOnly field can be used for synchronization purposes
  /// such as sound with animation. The value of a cycleTime event will be
  /// equal to the time at the beginning of the current cycle. A cycleTime
  /// event is generated at the beginning of every cycle, including the cycle
  /// starting at startTime. The first cycleTime event for a TimeSensor node
  /// can be used as an alarm (single pulse at a specified time).
  ///
  /// When a TimeSensor node becomes active, it generates an isActive = TRUE
  /// event and begins generating time, fraction_changed, and cycleTime events
  /// which may be routed to other nodes to drive animation or simulated
  /// behaviours. The behaviour at read time is described below. The time
  /// event sends the absolute time for a given tick of the TimeSensor node
  /// (SFTime/MFTime fields and events represent the number of seconds since
  /// midnight GMT January 1, 1970).
  ///
  /// fraction_changed events output a floating point value in the closed 
  /// interval [0, 1]. At startTime the value of fraction_changed is 0. After
  /// startTime, the value of fraction_changed in any cycle will progress
  /// through the range (0.0, 1.0]. At startTime + N × cycleInterval, for 
  /// N = 1, 2, ..., (i.e., at the end of every cycle), the value of 
  /// fraction_changed is 1.
  ///
  /// A TimeSensor node can be set up to be active at read time by specifying
  /// loop TRUE (not the default) and stopTime less than or equal to startTime
  /// (satisfied by the default values). The time events output absolute
  /// times for each tick of the TimeSensor node simulation. The time events 
  /// shall start at the first simulation tick greater than or equal to 
  /// startTime. time events end at stopTime, or at startTime + N × 
  /// cycleInterval for some positive integer value of N, or loop forever
  /// depending on the values of the other fields. An active TimeSensor node 
  /// shall stop at the first simulation tick when now = stopTime > startTime.
  ///
  /// No guarantees are made with respect to how often a TimeSensor node
  /// generates time events, but a TimeSensor node shall generate events at
  /// least at every simulation tick. TimeSensor nodes are guaranteed to 
  /// generate final time and fraction_changed events. If loop is FALSE at the
  /// end of the Nth cycleInterval and was TRUE at startTime + M cycleInterval
  /// for all 0 < M < N, the final time event will be generated with a value
  /// of (startTime + N × cycleInterval) or stopTime (if stopTime > startTime),
  /// whichever value is less. If loop is TRUE at the completion of every 
  /// cycle, the final event is generated as evaluated at stopTime (if
  /// stopTime > startTime) or never.
  /// 
  /// An active TimeSensor node ignores set_cycleInterval and set_startTime 
  /// events. An active TimeSensor node also ignores set_stopTime events for
  /// set_stopTime less than or equal to startTime. For example, if a
  /// set_startTime event is received while a TimeSensor node is active, that
  /// set_startTime event is ignored (the startTime field is not changed, and
  /// a startTime_changed event is not generated). If an active TimeSensor
  /// node receives a set_stopTime event that is less than the current time,
  /// and greater than startTime, it behaves as if the stopTime requested is
  /// the current time and sends the final events based on the current time
  /// (note that stopTime is set as specified in the field).
  /// 
  /// A TimeSensor read from a X3D file shall generate isActive TRUE, time 
  /// and fraction_changed events if the sensor is enabled and all conditions
  /// for a TimeSensor to be active are met.
