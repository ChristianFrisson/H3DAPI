  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class Shape
  /// \brief The Shape node has two fields, appearance and geometry, which 
  /// are used to create rendered objects in the world. 
  ///
  /// The appearance field contains an Appearance node that specifies the
  /// visual attributes (e.g., material and texture) to be applied to the
  /// geometry. The geometry field contains an X3DGeometryNode. The specified
  /// geometry node is rendered with the specified appearance nodes applied.
  /// If the geometry field is NULL, the object is not drawn.
  /// The hapticGeometry field also contains a X3DGeometryNode. If specified,
  /// this geometry will be used for haptic rendering, enabling separate 
  /// geometries for graphics and haptics. If hapticsGeometry is NULL, the 
  /// geometry in the geometry field will be used for haptics as well as 
  /// graphics.
  ///
  /// The bboxCenter and bboxSize fields specify a bounding box that
  /// encloses the Shape node's geometry. This is a hint that may be used
  /// for optimization purposes. The results are undefined if the specified
  /// bounding box is smaller than the actual bounding box of the geometry
  /// at any time. A default bboxSize value, (-1, -1, -1), implies that the
  /// bounding box is not specified and, if needed, is calculated by the
  /// browser.
