  /// \ingroup AbstractNodes
  /// \class X3DBindableNode
  /// \brief X3DBindableNode is the abstract base type for all bindable 
  /// children nodes, including Background, TextureBackground, Fog, 
  /// NavigationInfo, Viewpoint and DeviceInfo. 
  ///
  /// These nodes have the unique behaviour that only one of each type can be
  /// bound (i.e., affect the user's experience) at any instant in time. The 
  /// browser shall maintain an independent, separate stack for each type of
  /// bindable node. Each of these nodes includes a set_bind inputOnly field
  /// and an isBound outputOnly field. The set_bind inputOnly field is used to
  /// move a given node to and from its respective top of stack. A TRUE value
  /// sent to the set_bind inputOnly field moves the node to the top of the
  /// stack; sending a FALSE value removes it from the stack. The isBound
  /// event is output when a given node is:
  /// - moved to the top of the stack;
  /// - removed from the top of the stack;
  /// - pushed down from the top of the stack by another node being placed
  /// on top.
  ///
  /// That is, isBound events are sent when a given node becomes, or ceases 
  /// to be, the active node. The node at the top of the stack (the most
  /// recently bound node) is the active node for its type and is used by the
  /// browser to set the world state. If the stack is empty (i.e., either the
  /// X3D file has no bindable nodes for a given type or the stack has been
  /// popped until empty), the default field values for that node type are
  /// used to set world state. The results are undefined if a multiply 
  /// instanced (DEF/USE) bindable node is bound.
  ///
  /// The following rules describe the behaviour of the binding stack for a
  /// node of type <bindable node>:
  /// <ul>
  /// <li>
  /// During read, the first encountered <bindable node> is bound by pushing
  /// it to the top of the <bindable node> stack. The first encountered
  /// <bindable node> sends an isBound TRUE event.
  /// <li>
  /// When a set_bind TRUE event is received by a <bindable node>,
  /// <ol><li>
  /// If it is not on the top of the stack: the current top of stack node 
  /// sends an isBound FALSE event. The new node is moved to the top of the
  /// stack and becomes the currently bound <bindable node>. The new 
  /// <bindable node> (top of stack) sends an isBound TRUE event.
  /// <li>
  /// If the node is already at the top of the stack, this event has no effect.
  /// </ol>
  /// <li>
  /// When a set_bind FALSE event is received by a <bindable node> in the 
  /// stack, it is removed from the stack. If it was on the top of the stack,
  /// <ol><li>
  /// it sends an isBound FALSE event.
  /// <li>
  /// the next node in the stack becomes the currently bound <bindable node>
  /// (i.e., pop) and issues an isBound TRUE event. 
  /// </ol>
  /// <li>
  /// If a set_bind FALSE event is received by a node not in the stack, the
  /// event is ignored and isBound events are not sent.
  /// <li>
  /// When a node replaces another node at the top of the stack, the isBound
  /// TRUE and FALSE output events from the two nodes are sent simultaneously
  /// (i.e., with identical timestamps).
  /// <li>
  /// If a bound node is deleted, it behaves as if it received a set_bind
  /// FALSE event (see f above). 
  /// </ul>
  /// The results are undefined if a bindable node is bound and is the child
  /// of an LOD, Switch, or any node or prototype that disables its children.
