  /// \ingroup X3DNodes
  /// \class Sound
  /// \brief The Sound node specifies the spatial presentation of a sound in
  /// a X3D scene. 
  ///
  /// The sound is located at a point in the local coordinate system
  /// and emits sound in an elliptical pattern (defined by two
  /// ellipsoids). The ellipsoids are oriented in a direction specified by
  /// the direction field. The shape of the ellipsoids may be modified to
  /// provide more or less directional focus from the location of the
  /// sound. 
  ///
  /// The source field specifies the sound source for the Sound node. If the
  /// source field is not specified, the Sound node will not emit audio. The
  /// source field shall specify an AudioClip node . 
  ///
  ///  The intensity field adjusts the loudness (decibels) of the sound
  /// emitted by the Sound node. The intensity field has a value that ranges
  /// from 0.0 to 1.0 and specifies a factor which shall be used to scale the
  /// normalized sample data of the sound source during playback. A Sound node
  /// with an intensity of 1.0 shall emit audio at its maximum loudness 
  /// (before attenuation), and a Sound node with an intensity of 0.0 shall
  /// emit no audio. Between these values, the loudness should increase 
  /// linearly from a -20 dB change approaching an intensity of 0.0 to a 
  /// 0 dB change at an intensity of 1.0.
  ///
  /// The priority field provides a hint for the browser to choose which 
  /// sounds to play when there are more active Sound nodes than can be played
  /// at once due to either limited system resources or system load. The
  /// priority field ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 being the highest 
  /// priority and 0.0 the lowest priority.
  ///
  /// The location field determines the location of the sound emitter in the
  /// local coordinate system. A Sound node's output is audible only if it is
  /// part of the traversed scene. Sound nodes that are descended from LOD, 
  /// Switch, or any grouping or prototype node that disables traversal 
  /// of its children are not audible unless they are traversed. If a Sound 
  /// node is disabled by a Switch or LOD node, and later it becomes part of
  /// the traversal again, the sound shall resume where it would have been
  /// had it been playing continuously.
  ///
  /// The Sound node has an inner ellipsoid that defines a volume of space 
  /// in which the maximum level of the sound is audible. Within this 
  /// ellipsoid, the normalized sample data is scaled by the intensity field 
  /// and there is no attenuation. The inner ellipsoid is defined by extending
  /// the direction vector through the location. The minBack and minFront
  /// fields specify distances behind and in front of the location along the
  /// direction vector respectively. The inner ellipsoid has one of its foci
  /// at location (the second focus is implicit) and intersects the direction
  /// vector at minBack and minFront.
  ///
  /// The Sound node has an outer ellipsoid that defines a volume of space
  /// that bounds the audibility of the sound. No sound can be heard outside
  /// of this outer ellipsoid. The outer ellipsoid is defined by extending
  /// the direction vector through the location. The maxBack and maxFront 
  /// fields specify distances behind and in front of the location along the
  /// direction vector respectively. The outer ellipsoid has one of its foci
  /// at location (the second focus is implicit) and intersects the direction 
  /// vector at maxBack and maxFront.
  ///
  /// The minFront, maxFront, minBack, and maxBack fields are defined in local
  /// coordinates, and shall be greater than or equal to zero. The minBack
  /// field shall be less than or equal to maxBack, and minFront shall be less
  /// than or equal to maxFront. The ellipsoid parameters are specified in the
  /// local coordinate system but the ellipsoids' geometry is affected by 
  /// ancestors' transformations.
  ///
  /// Between the two ellipsoids, there shall be a linear attenuation ramp in
  /// loudness, from 0 dB at the minimum ellipsoid to -20 dB at the maximum
  /// ellipsoid:
  ///
  ///   attenuation = -20 × (d' / d")
  ///
  /// where d' is the distance along the location-to-viewer vector, measured 
  /// from the transformed minimum ellipsoid boundary to the viewer, and d" 
  /// is the distance along the location-to-viewer vector from the transformed
  /// minimum ellipsoid boundary to the transformed maximum ellipsoid boundary.
  /// 
  /// The spatialize field specifies if the sound is perceived as being
  /// directionally located relative to the viewer. If the spatialize field
  /// is TRUE and the viewer is located between the transformed inner and outer
  /// ellipsoids, the viewer's direction and the relative location of the
  /// Sound node should be taken into account during playback. If the
  /// spatialize field is FALSE, directional effects are ignored, but the 
  /// ellipsoid dimensions and intensity will still affect the loudness of
  /// the sound. If the sound source is multi-channel, the source shall retain
  /// its channel separation during playback.
