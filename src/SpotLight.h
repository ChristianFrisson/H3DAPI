  /// \ingroup Nodes
  /// \class SpotLight
  /// \brief The SpotLight node defines a light source that emits light from a
  /// specific point along a specific direction vector and constrained
  /// within a solid angle. 
  ///
  /// Spotlights may illuminate geometry nodes that
  /// respond to light sources and intersect the solid angle defined by the
  /// SpotLight. Spotlight nodes are specified in the local coordinate
  /// system and are affected by ancestors' transformations. 
  ///
  /// See X3DLightNode for a description of the ambientIntensity, color,
  /// and intensity fields. 
  /// 
  /// The location field specifies a translation offset of the centre point
  /// of the light source from the light's local coordinate system
  /// origin. This point is the apex of the solid angle which bounds light
  /// emission from the given light source. The direction field specifies
  /// the direction vector of the light's central axis defined in the local
  /// coordinate system. 
  ///
  /// The on field specifies whether the light source emits light. If on is
  /// TRUE, the light source is emitting light and may illuminate geometry
  /// in the scene. If on is FALSE, the light source does not emit light and
  /// does not illuminate any geometry. 
  ///
  /// Location is affected by ancestors' transformations.
  ///
  /// The cutOffAngle field specifies the outer bound of the solid
  /// angle. The light source does not emit light outside of this solid
  /// angle. The beamWidth field specifies an inner solid angle in
  /// which the light source emits light at uniform full intensity (in
  /// H3DAPI it can only be the entire beamWidth angle or 0). 
  /// If beamWidth is less than cutOffAngle then the intensity drops
  /// of linearly from the center of the spotlight to the beamWidth, i.e.
  /// the same as a beamWidth of 0. If the beamWidth is greater than 
  /// the cutOffAngle, beamWidth is defined to be equal to the 
  /// cutOffAngle and the light source emits full intensity within the 
  /// entire solid angle defined by cutOffAngle.
  ///
  /// SpotLight illumination falls off with distance as specified by three
  /// attenuation coefficients. The attenuation factor is: 
  ///
  ///  1/max(attenuation[0] + attenuation[1] × r + attenuation[2] × r2 , 1)
  ///
  /// where r is the distance from the light to the surface being
  /// illuminated. The default is no attenuation. An attenuation value of
  /// (0, 0, 0) is identical to (1, 0, 0). Attenuation values shall be
  /// greater than or equal to zero.
